	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sandor Dargo!</h1>
    <div class="row">    
        <div class="col-sm-8">
        	<p>I am a software craftsman whose biggest passion is continuous learning. 
        	After working as a database admin, I changed jobs and countries to become a software developer.	The more time I've spent on coding the more I realized how much fun it is and how much I love high quality code.
        	<p>Last year I joined the craftsmanship community in Amadeus which was the best thing could happen to me. It's an endless source of new experiences and learning. Also to meet great people from who I can learn or sometimes tho I can teach. It helps me to pursue my goal of writing clean code.
        	<p>This page serves as a tool to share some of my experiences mostly about IT.
