Booze Tracker is my first Flutter application. It's aim is to help users tracking their alcohol consumption.

This app is mainly not for alcoholics or heavy drinkers. They would most probably find it difficult to log every drink they have.

This app is more for those who consume a limited amount of alcohol and curious how much it is in reality.

I wrote more about this app [here](/blog/2018/09/12/my-first-flutter-app "My First Flutter App").

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/sandordargo/alcohol-tracker).
