I used to use another host to have a blog. As it tends to be down more than up, I was really happy when I read about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHubPages](https://pages.github.com). Thank you [Yegor](http://www.yegor256.com/)!
So I will lead a new blog here about what I do, what I learn, etc.
Let's rock!
