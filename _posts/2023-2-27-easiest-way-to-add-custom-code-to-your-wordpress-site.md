C++ is one of the most popular programming languages out there. The latest stats show that it’s now the [third-most popular language](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3682141/c-plus-plus-overtakes-java-in-language-popularity-index.html), surpassing Java for the first time since 2001.

Despite it being over 40 years old, C++ is still the language of choice for lots of coders across the globe. It is used for many things, like image-manipulation applications, 3D games, simulations, web browsers, and enterprise software.

That’s because [C++ is evolving](https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2022/11/09/why-to-use-cpp-in-2022). Because it is more complex than other programming languages, [a subcommittee of a multi-level organization](https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2022/06/29/cpp-standardized) is tasked with standardizing it. C++ now follows a train model and receives new versions every three years.

C++ is commonly used for large-scale software development, but it can also be used for web development projects. You may be wondering how to use it with WordPress, one of the most popular content management systems and [website builders](https://namechk.com/website-builders/best/) today.

While a lot of websites are built using WordPress as a foundation, it doesn’t necessarily mean that WordPress’s ecosystem is complete or well-rounded. For example, WordPress has a strong focus on users’ experience and bloggers’ needs, that’s why it relies on four languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. This means there are some limitations for developers who want to fully take advantage of its power.

While there are plugins like Custom Post Types to extend WordPress’s functionality, there aren't many ways to add new functionalities without starting from scratch.

Also, adding C++ code directly to a WordPress site is not recommended as it can potentially introduce security vulnerabilities and break the website. However, if there is a specific need to run C++ code on your WordPress site, here’s what you can do.

You can create a standalone C++ application or library and then expose it via a web API, which can be consumed by WordPress. Let’s take a look at the general steps:

\1. Write your C++ code and compile it into a standalone application or library.

\2. Expose the functionality of the C++ application or library via a web API. You can use a library use as cpprestsdk to create the API endpoints.

\3. Deploy the C++ application or library on a server, either on the same server as your WordPress site or on a separate server.

\4. In your WordPress site, use a plugin or custom code to make HTTP requests to the API and retrieve the results. You can use a library such as cURL to make such requests.

\5. Use the retrieved results in your WordPress site as needed.

Another way to add C++ functionality to a WordPress site is to use a plugin that allows you to embed C++ code directly into WordPress pages or posts. The steps would vary depending on the plugin you use, but here are some general steps that could help.

\1. Install an activate a plugin that supports C++ code on your WordPress site.

\2. Create a new page or post in WordPress and add the [cpp] shortcode to the content area.

\3. Within the [cpp] shortcode, add your C++ code.

\4. Publish the page or post and view it to see the embedded C++ code in action.

Again, note that adding C++ code directly into a page or post can be risky. It’s important to thoroughly test your implementation to ensure it’s secure and reliable.

Whichever method you use, it requires a solid foundation in C++ and WordPress integration skills. When it comes to WordPress, perhaps you’re better off with using a more site-friendly language like PHP.

If you want to learn more about C++ and how it can be maximized effectively for your project, you may explore my site or [read the books](https://www.sandordargo.com/books/) I’ve written on it. C++ is a fascinating and ever-evolving language, and adding it to your set of skills is advantageous.
