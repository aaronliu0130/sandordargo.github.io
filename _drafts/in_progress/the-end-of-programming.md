I have to write again something for joy. No, I'm not burning out, but I do have to find ways of entertaining myself while acheiving my goals.

You have to give up. While people say you cannot give up, if you are a parent you must give up.

You must give up something, because you cannot have it all.

You cannot be a good parent, while you're socializing, you have a heatly level of sleep and you try push yourself to the extremes professionally.

Le kel számolnom a vágyaimmal. Kívánok mindent, de semmit nem kaphatok meg. Mint a kivert kutya olyan vagyok, de max csak verni tudom.

I'm looking for the topic, I'm looking for the words to find me. I keep writing to get rid of the block, to find the block I have to write. Where are you?

How did I get there? Is there anything I have to share?

What shall I do, what shall I drink.

The Gilets Jaunes


The Yellow Vest people

The last few weeks in France were about the yellow vest people, the _gilets jaunes_ as they call themselves in French. After the French government/president decided to raise the taxes on the carburants, especially on diesel by a couple of cents per liter, people got outraged. A few hundreds of thousands of people got on the streets and started to block roundabouts, toll gates.

It was on a weekend, not a lot of people had to work, so it was easy to block those who had to or those who just wanted ot spend their weekends outside of their homes.

But the manifetations continued even during the weekdays and the next weekend the Champs-Elysees got covered in smoke and barricades.

As said, the manifestations started after the announcement of tax increases of 2 cents for petrol and 6 cents for diesel per liter. The previous is barely more than a percent and the latter is still not a huge amount.

Think about it like this, if your car consumes 7 liter per a 100 kms and you drive 25k kms a year, You'll barely pay 25/100 Euros a year. Given that you drive that much.

A couple of euros a month.

What's the big fuss about?

It's the distance between ordinary people and the elite.

While according to certain studies, 30 percent of French don't have the means to eat properly, cannot put meat and fresh fruits on the table every day, the public finance minister said that indeed, it's difficult to leave out of 950 Euros a month, when one has to spend around a 100 Euros pp in a Parisian restaurant not taking into account the wine.

This person wanted to show empathy... He didn't manage to.
