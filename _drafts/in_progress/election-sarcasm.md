Two stories to tell:

Michael is the project manager
B, C, D, E are contenders

Michael has the money, has the power. his project is advancing but has some issues. some parts are too expensive. some are buggy, some are crap, but it does its task well
Michael has no incentive to do it better
Micheal likes luxurios business trips

the others don't really propose anything, they just don't like how things are managed
each of them wants to be a project manager, but they cannot convince each other, in fact they hate each other

new CEO comes, who doesn't like Michael
B, C, D, E try to get rid off the program manager
they try to screw Michael at CEO level. they cannot come up with a viable proposition. they cannot do it together
sometimes they might want




The sun shines in the huge windows of a well-designed Bauhaus villa. The warm rays langing on Micheals face wake him up. Another day starts. Michael is an old warrior, he's seen many things. He had his ups and downs of his career, but he's been on the up side of a while. He is the product manager of upstream oil manufactiring of TrockOil Coproration. He likes his position. He always wanted to fo this and he never had the intention to become a CEO or. For him it would have meant to leave the field...

Lately he had some problems. Not significant enough to worry about them, but promblematic enough that needs special management. The new CEO doesn't like his stlye. The board appointed a new CEO in order to find some new markets, to build a bit different brand. The new CEO comes out of the industry. Doesn't understand the main problematics.

safety own his crew is very important. his family is also very important. why not to leave well. does it hurt anyone?

  Michael visszagondol
Uj CEO
Eszebe jut, amikor mar poziban volt es bemoszeroltak. Konnyelmu volt.
Azota sokat valtozott. Felnott a csaladja. Megkemenyedett maga is. Talan tulsagaosan is.
Uj CEO elbeszelget vele
Csinalja tovabb a dolgat
Betamadja B
Mennek tovab a dolgok, betamadja C
Mennek tovabb a dolgok betamadja B,C,D , de nem mukodnek egyutt
a CEOnak mas elkepzelesei vannak. idelista, fiatal, stb. de nem tud megbizni a tamadokban. hazugok, nem kinalnak valojaban semmi jot
