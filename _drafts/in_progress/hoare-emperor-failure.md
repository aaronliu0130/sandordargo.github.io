But we did not seek to excuse our failure by these grievances. For example, we admitted that it was the
duty of programmers to educate their managers and other departments of the company by "...presenting
the necessary information in a simple palatable form." The hope "that deficiencies in original program
specifications could be made up by the skill of a technical writing department . . . was misguided; the
design of a program and the design of its specification must be undertaken in parallel by the same
person, and they must interact with each other. A lack of clarity in specification is one of the surest signs
of a deficiency in the program it describes, and the two faults must be removed simultaneously before
the project is embarked upon." I wish I had followed this advice in 1963; I wish we all would follow it
today.
My notes of the 

SPECS!!!


When any new language design project is nearing completion, there is always a mad rush to get new
features added before standardization. The rush is mad indeed, because it leads into a trap from which
there is no escape. A feature which is omitted can always be added later, when its design and its
implications are well understood. A feature which is included before it is fully understood can never be
removed later. 

warnings against the obscurity, the complexity, and overambition of the new design, but my warnings
went unheeded. I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated
that there are no obvious deficiencies. 

But there is one quality that cannot be purchased in this way - and that is reliability. The
price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard
to pay
