I realized recently how important it is to have a good working environment. I don't mean that you need nice colleagues. They are not a need.

I mean your own workstation and project sanity.

I started to contribute to a project which doesn't directly belong to our team, but we have some parts in it that we are responsible for. It's based on an an internal Java framework. Unluckily, some of the nested dependencies plus the in-house deployment tool make is impossible for the moment to have the project run on a Linux machine.



i don't follow my standards when i work on in a shitty env
