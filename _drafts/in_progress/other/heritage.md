I never felt I knew enough about my family. Sure, I asked some questions and my father told me some stories about his father and his father's 9 siblings. I knew where by grandfather was born, what kind of work he did. I knew about my father's mother who passed away too early, where she came from. But I didn't know much about the history of the family. I knew about a distant relative who had a title, but she orphaned early and the lawyers stole all her money. It might be true, it might be a family legend. I don't know.

On my mother's side I knew a bit more because I knew my grandparents, I even had information 4 or 5 generations back. I knew that some of my ancestors came from Germany, which is not a big surprise given that my grandma was Schwab, I also knew that 5th generations ago Uncle Scarpis had to leave Sicily and somehow he ended in Hungary.

But this was not from my grandfather side. I didn't know anything about his family. I knew some about his life. I knew he had to leave a shop behind when the "liberator" communists took over and he had to hide and he had some adventurous years until he later made a career in the state grocery chain. He still had some problems with the state, it happened that the black car stopped in front of the house and took him for a few days of "discussions". I still vomit from whatever successors of the communists.

A few weeks ago, my brother shared a letter with me. A letter he received from our municipality. 18 years after the death of grnadpa, we inherited a little bit after him in his hometown. It's not worth much, maybe a week of salary or so.

I immedittely asked for the corresponding estate records. So many names. I knew some, but the rest... who are they? From where these estates are coming from?

My best hope was my uncle, the only living child of my grandparents.

He sent me a link to the Hungarian E-Library, I opened the link and there was a 500 pages long biography of my ancestors with a big coat-of-arms on the cover. Wow. My great-great-grandmother was the last one in my line using that name, she married a guard of Franz-Joseph.

Does it change my life? Not directly, but it's nice to know our roots, especially if we can get more information about how they used to live, how they thought, what they worked, what thoughts they passed on their children, grandchildren. We are like trees. Without strong roots, we cannot strive and one way of having strong roots is to have strong family traditions. I didn't get those just because I learnt a little bit about their history, but still...

Did I mention to get some information about how they used to live, etc? I got more information than I looked for. Way more. The brother of my great-great-grandmother was something like a hero at a certain point of his life, but he wrote his name in Hungary's history with all black. And it's better, not to go deeper in this shameful story.

Speaking about shame. I understood why I didn't know much about my ancestors. I immediately understood some of the fears, the glances, the words of my grandfather. I understand them, but I cannot agree with them.

I think that children are not responsible in any way for their parents' sins. It was obvisouly different under a communist dictatorship where even owning a shop was something sinful, not to mention having *high-profile* relatives.

I think that a kid is not responsible in any way for their parents acts. It's totally possible that a person who does horrible things is a loving father or uncle. After all, most people don't do bad things because they want to do bad things. They do what they thing is right. Even if it involves torturing or killing people. They believe in a higher good. Don't get me wrong, this doesn't exonarete them of their sins, not at all. But it's completely possible that they are loving family people while they... do very bad things.

On the other hand, there is a responsibility in the children's lives how they interpret their parents' lives, what they share about it. Many such children talk in public about how their parents loved them, how adorable they were after they came home from work (work == torturing, killing people, right [Mr Bauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam%C3%A1s_Bauer)?). It's completly not OK and disgusting to share "lvoely stories" about monsters who are responsible for deaths of dozens, hundreds, or thousands of people, or even of just one. That's the point where children start sharing responsibilty and become unacceptable.

I'm not one of them, not even from 4 generations away and apparently my grandfather was not such a person either.
