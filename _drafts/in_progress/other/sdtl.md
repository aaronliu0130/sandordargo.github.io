## intelligence en essaim

with simple intelligence resolve complex issues
like the ants

idea for robots

drone shows of 3-400 instances to make some shapes etc

research with robots
research the trees malades
small robots could move big thigns

## strategies

centralised - like the army, we deicde in advance, no improv

distributed - simple and vague directives

hybrid

distributed worked better

with the change of one parameter the centralized were impacted a lot

no need to wait for the boss!


## cycle en V vs Agile

## agile en echelle like a decentrailzed swarm

explaroty tests with simple distributed logic


## conclsion

decentralisation let's you adapt faster

let your experienced/studies people think! and make decisions!
that's what Harley did when they had big issues

no anarchy by the way, 

i wonder if it's like linux


----------

what should you do?

if you think about the stoic philosophy, you have to ask yourself a couple of things

what bothers you? define it well
then, think whether you can change it

if you can, then go and try to change it, do whatever you can

if you cannot, you rather accept it and don't complain about it. life is not fair and full of unicorn dust, whatever. so complaining about fairness doesn't lead anywhere.

from an other perspective, growth requires discomfort. and humans are built for gworth. growth requires challenge, high load.

there you have it. it's better to be happy for it than complain about it
