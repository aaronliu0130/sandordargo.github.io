Satyr!
Hi Nouemann,

Thanks, I'm fine. What about you? Have you found some job?

Haha, right. I prefer to work form home.

Most of my pieces of advice are not specific probably to home office or simply not very original.

What do I have in mind?

Don't do too long days, because you won't sustain it and then it's difficult to get back on schedule.

Eat normal amounts and relatively healty food. I say relatively, because I'm not into these specific diets, whatever. But I think it's important to cook something nomral and don't live on frozen meals.

Drink enough. I mean water.

We all have our limits, but considering our means, don't be cheap on your setup. I postponed buying a proper chair and a desk for months because I thought I'd have to return to the office soon anyway. My back started to hurt. I bought a chair from Amazon for about 90 Euros and it's just great.

It's not just about your productivity, but your health.

Regarding productivity, I'm not really motivated by my surrounding but my goals. I know how it sounds. But think about it. If you sit down in front of the computer and start to work because you want to achieve something, it's so much different from sitting down and work because your boss might pass by and catch you playing the good old snake all day. (Yes, I saw that kind of thing.)

Of course, you cannot stay motivated all the time. There are ups and downs. So you need some systems.

I always keep a moderately refined task list. So I know from what I can choose from, if I need to pick something.

At the same time, I have an accountability partner. You can read more about it here:

I just ran into this, this is also interesting:

In practice it means that each evening I set 3 goals for the next day, and at the same time of setting the goals, I report back wether I succeeded with the previous ones or not. And it's just human nature that you want to succeed.

When I went to a time management training, I put some notes, here is what I found the most interesting.
