Conferences are fascinating and they are a great way to boost your career.

Yes, most of the content is usually available online. In case of a bit more important conference, not only the slides but even the video recordings. Many say that the true value is in socializing. Tell that to an introvert!

I'm not even in danger for the coronavirus, let alone socializing with complete strangers at a conference!

Do you get sugar overdose and tons of stickers if you go on youtube? No, but you can still eat your own cookies in great quantities if diabetes and some extra weight are what you are looking for!

While I would be interested in many video recordings, I barely watch them, they are so overwhelming. On the other hand, if I go to a conference, obviously, I'll do my best to pay attention to.

Of course, going on youtube costs you "only" your personal data. You don't have to pay up to thousands out of your pocket. Going to a local conference might require you to take some days off, not to mention prime conferences where you might have to travel to, book some accommodation and pay a decent entry fee.

I find that not so many corporations will help you going to conferences, even though the same big companies provide (sometimes) good quality courses by external instructors to their employees.

They don't serve the exact same purposes, but on average, I find conferences more inspiring, their effects last longer, they make me think, tinker, investigate more after I returned home.

So what can you do if you want to go to a conference, but your employer will not give you the possibility to trade some courses in exchange for a good conference?

You can pay for one of course! Yet, I think it's not the best option you have in your hands. 

Talk at one!

You'll have - in most cases - free access to a great event, they might cover your travel and accommodation, but speaking at a conference will also advance your career!

No, not because potential employers will line up at your door giving the handle to each other begging you to join them for a tripled salary. [You'll still get rejections](https://twitter.com/TartanLlama/status/1233042928702042112), Though I think that having some favorable reviews and high-quality recordings can increase your chances to get hired, it's not the most important effect of speaking at a conference.

It might also increase your reputation internally, it can help you get to know experts and open some doors, which otherwise can be a difficult task - especially for an introvert.

But still, I wouldn't recommend you to speak at a conference so that more people know you in-house. Or externally. It doesn't matter that much after all.

There is something much better.

Slowly, but much faster than otherwise, you will become an expert.

Let's say you got accepted to a conference where you'll speak about a professional topic. I emphasize the professional topic, because I, for example, have talked about [sourdough baking]() and [my family travels]() at IT conferences. These presentations were more about sharing passion, practice public speaking and building up credibility so that later I can speak about professional topics. The former requires different efforts than the latter.

So you did your fair research and you submitted such a good proposal that you got accepted to a conference even without being a notable expert of your industry. What's the first thing that you'll do?

You'll feel super proud! And you should! You had the courage, the perseverance to submit dozens of proposals and finally, you nailed it!

And you know what's gonna happen next? You'll start questioning yourself what the hell are you going there on the same stage possibly with people you admire, whose books formed your professional identity, whose videos you watched to become a better version of yourself.

Then you'll pull your shit together and spend a long time preparing.

You won't procrastinate anymore watching those related videos, reading the papers on the topic you'll talk about.

You will grab every local opportunity to practice your talk. You'll present it to your team, division, at local meetups. Wherever you can, wherever it makes sense.

You will ask the most knowledgeable people around you to share their thoughts, add content and also to remove the inaccuracies and less interesting parts, in fact, you'll reach out to experts to teach and mentor you.

By the time you'll get to the conference, you will still not be an expert. Don't fool yourself. It takes more time and any way we all should be humble. But you will have learned much more about your topic that you'd have learned in years if you hadn't applied and got accepted.

By applying (and being accepted), you made a hard commitment, a public one on delivering great content. And without a deep understanding of the subject, it's impossible - unless maybe for some exceptionally talented speakers. Maybe...

Speaking at a conference is fun and satisfying. But it's like becoming a millionaire, you don't do it for a specific moment. As the self-made American businessman, Jim Rohn said _"become a millionaire not for the million dollars, but for what it will make of you to achieve it.‚Äù_ 

Become a conference speaker not for the perks and the questionable fame, but for what it will make of you to deliver a great talk.
