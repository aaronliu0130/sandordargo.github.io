In [The Battle Hardened Developer]() [Fiodar Sazanavets]() talks a lot about echo chambers. How they are both dangerous and useful for developers. In this article, let's review what echo chamber is, what are the points of Fiodar about them and then let's see if a company can create such chambers when they are remote first.

## What is an echo chamber?

An echo chamber is an environment where you mostly face the same opinions that you agree with. Or disagree with. In fact an echo chamber is not about whether you agree or disagree with certain ideas. It's simply about facing always the same ideas.

## Are they bad...?

In an echo chamber, you'll lose the points of views of those who think otherwise and you lose many aspects.

Social media platforms are quite good in creating echo chambers. You can easily find yourself in a circle where you only hear and read similar opinions all the time and you are either very happy about it, or you get annoyed and alway engage in hostile discussions.

In any case, the goal is to maximize the time you spend on the application, site, etc.

It seems probably straightforward that considering always just one side doesn't lead to productive discussions, doesn't help to understand each other and it actually leads to a very polarized society. A society that we are actually living in and one that actually gets worse and worse.

## ... or is there a good side of echo chambers?

Some suggests that we should follow content of those who think really differently, but Fiodar suggests else. At least partly. We should unfollow people who regularly post opposing opinions in a way that it creates strong emotional responses in us. Strong emotional responses derail us from our daily routines and therefore it's against our career progression. On the other hand, it's still useful to hear those who think differently, but who express themselves in  way that doesn't provoke those strong reactions.

So far we mostly thought about echo chambers that are related to our religious or political views. But that's not the only kind. It's worth creating echo chambers where we hear back the same best practices of our profession. Echo chambers where are faced with TDD, SOLID, clean code, XP practices all the time. We should be actively creating such echo chambers around ourselves.

And there is one more kind of echo chamber, which I'm not sure if it was mentioned in the book, but it's definitely worth thinking about. The echo chamber of our workplaces. Think about Meta/Facebok and all those famous posters that are all around its campuses. Think about the screens where company messages, KPIs, etc. are running. They are not the only ways for companies to create their own echo chambers for their employees, but definitely an important way. They help keeping employees like a magnet (though not a very strong one), they are a way to retain people.

With remote work, such echo chambers are losing from their power. Or are they? Can companies cretes similarly strong echo chambers when they are fully or partly remote? Should they in the first place? What's the goal of such echo chambers?

Probably this last question si the origo of our quest.

## What is the goal of an echo chamber?

The goal of an echo chamber is to enforce certain messages in order to transform you. As the proverb says you're the combination of the 5 people you spend the most time with. So you should be picky on chosing the people you spend time with, because they will transofrm you for the better or the worse.

Echo chambers are serving similar purposes. They will define you, transform you for the better or the worse, so you should be picky about them. Companies should also be careful about designing the echo chambers they are creating.

And yes, I think they should be actively creating echo chambers. I personally hate when compenies are defining themselves as your new families. 

First of all, it's a lie. You might find some friends, you might even marry someone from your workplace, but your colleagues are not your family. People will come and go, managers will ditch you in difficult times to protect the company. I hope your family wouldn't leave you behind like that.

Second, defining your company as your family creates false expectations.

But creating a certain a level of belonging is important when it comes with other items of retention policies. I do think that the main motivation to be in a job is to make a good money, but I admit, it's not the only one. There are companies I wouldn't work for because I think they have a negative effect on society and there are some that do more interesting stuff - for me - than others. Some care more about these even than money. It's important to emphasize on these as well as comapny values, as well as on good technical practices.

Workplace are not responsible for educating developers - it's the responsibility of the developers to educate themselves - but they should invest in employee education. It's for their own good too.

Creating echo chambers are a good way to promote certain practices, to create a culture of learning.

## Can still create such strong echo chambers in a remote world?

My gut answer is yes, of course. After all, these echo chambers are often mentioned in relation with social media which is something very virtual. But it's not that simple for companies. Why is so?

You use social media to stimulate your brain. To get some free endorphines, to connect with friends, to procrastinate, to avoid real-world activities, such as work.

At work, you want people not to avoid work, not to connect with friends, but to focus on your tasks and deliver.

If you build your internal social media and it's too good, productivity will plummet, people will spend too much time scrolling, commenting, etc. If it's not good enough, it might be useless. You have to find a balance.

After all, it's probably not the channel that matters that much. What really matters is that you feel that people really mean it.

Let's say that your comapny wants to have a culture where people strongly care about quality. Let's put aside that [quality is something really hard to define](https://devreads.sandordargo.com/zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-by-robert-pirsig/). But at least it's often easy to notice when quality is neglected. In such circumstances, don't expect to create an echo chamber. But when you feel that people do care, even if sometimes they make jokes about the strong efforts, it will really sink in.

I used to work for an American oil company. That's a dangerous business. Not for the IT workers for sure, but safety is equally important for everyone. There were many safety related events. Besides those dedicated meetings, each and every meeting had to start with safety minutes. We reviewed where and how to leave in case of emergency, plus someone had to share something that was somehow related to safety.

Yes. Sometimes it's dull. Sometimes people made fun of it. A lot... Me too... But we understood that they did care, they spent a lot of money promoting safety and they tried to make it relevant even in an office context. I still think that having mirrors on the ceiling at the corners was a good idea and did prevent sometimes people bumping into each other.

It did sink in and I still approach activities with the safery mindset think about what can go wrong and how could I avoid it. How I caould have avoided an accident. 

Let's say that this American oil major was succesful in creating an echo chamber.

What did they do?

- They chose a topic that was important for them.
- They made it relevant for the employees by tailoring what safety meant in different contexts.
- They made the employees invested by the various reward programs and by lifting the idea into performance reviews
- After all, they invested money into the idea and they did care

## How could they do the same in a remote context?

## How to create a quality echo chamber?

(Make it more concreate than quality)

As I mentioned, quality is somthing that is hard ot grasp. Let's be a bit more specific. I'm a big fan of Sandro Mancuso's book [the software craftsmanship]() and we tried to establish the related best practices in our teams. Pair programming, TDD, timeboxing, clean code, whatever.

Speaking a lot about these practices, making presentations (not by managers) is important and useful. It's good to catch attention of the people. But don't expect that they will take their time to learn and practice. There are some people who are so immersed in their profession that they dedicate their own free time to hone their skills. But that's not the norm and even if you're a person like that, you cannot expect it from others to do similarly.

So if you want to create an echo chamber that leads to change, you have to provide the people the opportunity to practice. And it's better than in a social setting. By social I don't mean that you should physically meet, remote is also fine. There are tools to conduct good remote pair programming sessions. We use VS Code Live share and it works pretty weel. It improved a lot during the last year in terms of reliability.
