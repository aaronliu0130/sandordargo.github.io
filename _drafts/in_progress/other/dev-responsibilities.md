I took my usual weekend afternoon power walk and I was listening to a motivational speech. Like I usually do during the the first third of these walks.

Sometimes, what I hear doesn't really stick - probably on an unconscious level it still does - but this time it did.

"You're right is my responsbilitiy" - as Jordan B. Peterson said.

It's so bloody true. My right to learn for free was the responsiblity of the previous generations' taxpayers. Even my generations' as not everyone went for higher education. Many started to work and to pay taxes. Of course, we can say that this is an investment that paid off because then I worked for higher salaries, thus I paid more taxes.

If we ignore that you might pay your higher taxes in a different country, it's probably true.

Yet, it doesn't change the fact that paying for my education was the responsibility of others.

Don't get me wrong, this is not about education. The right to free healthcare, the right to access the internet is the responsibility of others. Heck, the (diminishing) right of free speech is also the responsibility of others. After all, the state has to keep an order where I'm not beaten by the mob because I express what I think, or my boss cannot sack me because of my differing views.

Any right, will be the responsibility of others.

We often forget this.

We also forget that we don't only have rights, but we have responsibilities too. According to my values, we cannot claim any rights as long as we don't fulfill our responsibilities.

I have to right to this, I have to right to that. But what do I give instead? What responsibilities do I take?

On the same day when I watched this video, I accidentally came across this thread on twitter about the Remote Worker's Bill of Rights. I started to feel some nauseau.

Rights, rights, rights again.

While most of the items are valid, the precontext is something I cannot identify with. Companies must provide these fundamentals.

Why the hell would be my employer responsible for the fact that my flat is noisy. I chose that flat, it's my responsibility where I live.

Why would be the company responsible for all meetings having an agenda? It's my responsibility whether I accept such invitation or not. I barely. Did it lead to some conflicts? It did, but only in a few cases. Most often, people accepted and relaized that it's the right expectation.

But I don't want to go through that list.

What I rather want to speak about is that instead of the programmer of rights, we should be the programmer of responsibilities.
