It's Christmas once again.

I love it and hate it at the same time.

If I think about Christmas, I remember standing around the tree holding each others hands singing Christmas songs.

The first one was always about a beautiful christmas tree and a warm, freshly baked scone. Thinking about this song, I started to think that it's only the invention of the antireligious Communist era, but no.

It's older than that, though the song has a second part about little Jesus and Holy Mary. A part I never heard anywhere.

Once we finished this song, my grandmother started to sing about the angles coming down from heaven to show the way to the shepherds.

That's past. After my mother passed away, we never had the same intimacy.

During the first Christmas, 5 months after she had passed away we had a terrible Christmas. In fact, it was not terrivle, it was simply not Christmas. We had a tree, we had some gifts - I guess - I don't remember.

We ate, we were there, my grandma went down to her flat, and we stayed with my 5 year old brother. My father went into his room and layed down with a serious headache. I think he was crying.

I couldn'y stay.

Someone called me that she passed by Csepel with her parents and we could meet if I wanted to.

We went to probably the sole pub being open on the Holy night and started to drink.

Probably that was my weirdest Christmas.

I was so grateful for her to save me.

Now almost 20 years after, I don't feel much better about Christmas.

I love Christmas. No, not the gifts. Being together with the family and having good times. I now that its religious meaning is something completely different and I truly appreciate it, but it's not the meaning it has for me.

The joy on my kids faces when they decorate the tree.

That they wait for "the big day" whole December, they count the days on the calendar.

But when you live with someone metnally ill, each day is difficult.

Days that should be great become even more difficult, probably because of the expectations.

Maybe the problem is inside me. Maybe the problem lives in my expectations.

The family slept late. It was well past after 8 o'clock that they woke up. It gave me a lot of time in the morning to read and to work on my course.

It would have been better to prepare something in the kitchen, but if I start doing such work, everyone wakes up. Our apartment is nto so big and the kitchen and the children's bedroom shares a wall.

We had simple breakfast and we were finishing around 9. My wife started to enumerate what we should do till noon.
- Tidy the living room
- Decorate the tree
- Make lunch

In three hours.

It hardly seemed possible, but let's give it a try.

We finished drinking our coffee and I told my wife to be the chef as she was looking for the menu, but she refused. She didn't want to be the chef that day.

I took my paracetamol so that I can make it till noon after the third vaccince that I got after a day of fever and I went to the kitchen.

I started to read the recipes and do the necessary preparations.

Peel and chop the butternet. Peel the garlic. Peel the potatoes, the sweet potato (we talk about different recipes!). Peel the mushroom.

She went on to the bathroom to put wash her face and put on some makeup.

Soon she started to sort our children's books from the shelf, cover the floor and group them.

I didn't understand why or especially why now. If that's something she felt important, I understand, but why didn't she do it the day before. Or days before. All the cleaning could have been done way earlier.

We had a sort of agreement that I pass the vacuum cleaner and mop the floor and clean the bathroom on a regular basis and she does the deep cleaning. Since both kids are school and she does charity two morning as a week, it's not something impossible.

It worked all fine as lons she took her pills. Since she agreed with her therapist to cut the dose in half, little by little the situation started to degenerate in most sense.

She is yelling again more and more with everyone. I don't really give a shit anymore when I'm at the cross, but I feel bad for the kids.

While I was thinking about this she started to yell at the kids to get the hell out of the living room and go their rooms because they... They were just kids and saw their books all over the place.

I'm sure they were disturbing, but there are always better ways.

Sure, sometimes I also lose my calm, everyone does. What matters is the frequency, I think.

Poor little ones.

It happened a few times more, after they didn't come out, only to the kitchen once in a while to "help me". I love that and I try to be patient.

I remember I wanted to help my father a lot when I was a kid, but I was not a fast learner when it came for DIY. He was always impatient and angry at me, I remember telling him that I won't help him ever again.

I'm still not really good in DIY, but I try to mend things more and more because handymen are unreliable and also expensive...

In any case, I try not to be with them like my father was with me.

In the meanwhile, things were more or less on track in the kitchen.

I had a look outside.

"So you will spend the whole time in the kitchen?"

"I think it's going to be fine soon.", I shruged. Like if I really had a choice. Lunch is lunch. The tree can stand in dust or can be decoreated after lunch.

She took the vacuum cleaner and asked if I could help with somethign.

She thought for a second and said no, you still haven't took the shower.

True. I took the kids to brush their teeth.

Then mine.

I had a look at my watch and I realized that it's no time for a shower, I better put the potatoes in the oven. In any case, that's something my son could help. He really enjoys being in the kichen with me and be daddy's little cook.

It was time to bring in the tree.

The kids started to put on the bowls. I also put some and then I picked up my son and helped him to put the star on the top.

I went back to the kitchen.

"Why is daddy not helping us?"

"He is helping in the kitchen."

The decoration went relatively well, mywife only seldom shouted at the kids to pay more attention and don't do anything nasty.

It was a nice tree.

Not very tall, around 150 centimeters and very proportionate. Probably the nicest tree we ever had since we moved to France. In Hungary, most people still set the tree on the 24th of December. In France, most families do that in the beginning of the month. As such, the closer you get to Christmas, the more doffocilt it is to find a decent tree. This ear, we baught it around 10 days in advance and kept it on the balcony. Lucikily it survived well.

After quickly chaning my payamas to a shirt and shorts combination, I served the butternut soup with a few slices of magret de canard and some foie gras quite on time, It was good, the combination even with the hazelnuts worked fine.

The main dish was magret de canard with some mushroom from the mountain and sweet potato puree and gingerbread sauce.

Unlike the first course, this was not a masterpiece at all. The magret de canard was overcooked, the sides were cold and Lilla was unhappy with the proportion of the sides served. Too little sides for the meat.

In any case, the spoon and the microwave helped her out.

I think she was kind of okay with the gingerbread sauce and I'm happy for that. It was clearly not my style, it was both too sweet and too salty at the same time.

Once we finished, I served some champagne, still before the dessert. The kids wanted something or maybe they jsut wanted to go, but all they got was some more yelling.

I was disgusted.

Finally, the dessert. The Christmas log ice cream.

I was so happy to see that I managed to choose one that both kids liked! That's real happiness and because of multiple reasons.

A parent is inherently happy when their kids eat something with joy. Even if it's just a great pile of sugar.

The other reason is that the day before Lilla took the kids to the city. She always brings them to do some arts&crafts, to take a ride on the merry-go-round, etc. On the 23rd, they also stopped by their favourite place to eat cupcakes. Unluckily they didn't have what my son wanted and what he got in the end, he didn't finish. What he got from her mother is not something he'd be happy to share.

I was moving back and forth between the kitchen and the living room where we ate to clean up the mess.

My wife asked me if I wanted some more champage. I said, no thanks, with a tone clearly saying leave me alone and I just took one more paracetamol.

Finally, I could go to the toilet to make a dump that I usually do in the morning, once everyone is already awake. And I could take my morning shower.

After a long time, I used the dishwasher once again, at least the dirty plates and cutlery could go in and what remained to me was only the pans and pots.

Sleeping time was finally aproaching.

It didn't mean complete rest, but it was better. Lilla left a thorough and reasonable message from where and what kind of presents I had to deliver under the tree that I immediately started to do.

I almost forgot but I put back to the stew the cooked carrot slices of Rudolph and I ate most of the portioning of Santa with a glass of cold milk, even though a cold whiskey would have been just as great.

Then I had a bit more than an hour for myself. A gift, I appreciate so much and I feel sorry for Lilla that she cannot leave the bedroom. I heard she had to once, soon she was softly shouting "leave me alone, I'm on the toilet". Dani really doesn't sleep well without her.

At 4 PM I received a message from her on that let's wake up Dalma. Okay, so, Daniel must be already awake. I had not much time to think, my phone immediately started to ring. I go, I go.

They were up to full speed so fast that we barely had the time to blink. They were in front of the Christmas tree amonf all the presents. Lilla made such a great job at looking for the presents and wrapping them.

The unwrapping went quite well.

Dalma received a magic wand, long blue gloves and some angel wings. She has a princess gown and she wanted to take it on. For some reason, her mother didn't want to tell her anything, she just directed her to me. Why on earth she couldn't enjoy this afternoon as she wanted? I went on with her and let her change. She was so happy and gorgeaus.

Then we called the grandparents, in the meanwhile Lilla poured a glass of champagne. I asked her to bring one to me too.

The call went on for a long time, the kids showed all their things, they really enjoyed it. 

Once the call ended, dinner was already quite close. Luckily the dinner went all fine, not much happened.

The bath time happened as usual, I took care of the kids, while Lilla tried to bring some order into the chaos left behind by them.

Lilla came out early from the kids' room. I offered a coupe de champage to her, but I don't think we drank anything while we were sitting next to each other. Our mood was quite dark, we were just sitting next to each other without touching at all.

Finally, after a few minutes, I left and went back to my desk to write. 

What a Holy Eve.

In the morning, we were supposed to ride some poneys.

In the morning, she was all helpful.
At noon, she was helpful.
She woke up in the afternoon and she said she is not in the mood of preparing dessert for tomorrow. She didn't make any of the Christmas desserts. But she sends me the recipe. Thanks, no thanks.
She goes away in our room whole afternoon, while either I play with the kids or they watch some cartoons.
She helps with the dinner, then she goes back.
