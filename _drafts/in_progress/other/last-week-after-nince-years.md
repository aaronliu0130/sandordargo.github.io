This is my last week with Amadeus. I leave the compnany on the 20th October 2022.

I'm 37 years old and I spent 9 years with Amadeus. I spent the quarter of life so far here.

Is it time to draw some kind of balance?

Probably yes.

We moved here with my wife for this job. She learnt French and probably mine also improved. It's not that I spoke so well, it's more about working mostly in an international community. We had the chance to travel quite a lot. We visited lots of places in France, but we spent a long vacation in Tuscany, but we also went Japan, Vietnam, the Azores Islands and New York. Thanks to my work, I even visited India twice, a fascinating experience. We've been enjoying beaches of our new home, the French Riviera, the mountains of the Alps. Our two kids were born.

Nine years is a lot of time in our personal life.

And professionally?

It's even more!

I've been working since 2006, since 2010 in IT. Those 9 years represent 56%-75% of them respecitvely. And a 100% of my developer career.

I'll always appreciate that I was accepted for a developer job without any dev experience and Amadeus took on the bet to investing me. Of course, this is not a one-sided story. First, I already had the skills to work in a multinational organization and I had quite good "soft skills" compared to my age. Skills that are soft, but in fact quite hard to get. Harder than programming skills.

Still, I will never forget that.

I'll always remember my first team. I had difficult times. I changed countries, jobs, fields. And I started with C++.

Sometimes I was sitting there for long hours when I finally aksed for help and Andrey came to add a semicolon, or remove a pair of parentheses.

I had welcoming team where people took their time to stop and explain what and how I should do.

If I asked they spent even more time on me and they explained the how.

I can thank a lot for Andrey, Samuel and Xavier (that's an alphabetical order). Andrey thought me mostly about C++, Samuel about Python and design patterns and Xavier about general programming concepts. If it were not them, probably I would have never ended up focusing on knowledge sharing so much.

My first manager, Joel helped me gain confidence.

My second manager, Rubens did the most important thing probably any of my managers did to me. He gave me a book. He gave me the.... He told me that I'm not really a junior anymore - I think I was - and if I want to further grow I shoudl read ... And I did. Then I asked for a second book, a third one and now I cannot stop reading.

My desire to get better was always very deep. Despite being an introvert, I went to an internal software craftsmanship meetup. We did pair coding. We learnt about clean code. We had to communicate. I had to communicate with senior people who I didn't know before. It was another game changer.

It was a big loss when the organizer, Alessandro left the company so that he could move to Japan to be with his wife. Nevertheless I didn't lose what I already learnt and the connections I already built. I got to know Christian there with who I became teammates when I moved to a new team after 4 and a half years.

When I joined that team I was looking for more Java prjoects, but apart from a few minor fixes, I ended up working on C++. Christian was often talking about things that I didn't understnad, usually realated to C++ and usually when I was already turned off my computer and was about to leave. Stil, I was grateful. I also decided that I have to learn C++ better, otherwi I'll suffer and hate my job.

That was in 2018, and alhough my blog was already out there, but at this moment it got its meaning. Documenting what I learn, documenting my journey. Due to the positive experience with my first team I wanted to share what I learn. Besides, I also raelized that if I have to write things down, I'll understand those things better. 

I spent 4 good years in that team, that's where I officially became a senior and later a principal engineer. I had good managers there, but my first senior manager, Sergio was arguably the best I have ever had. He didn't just talk about open door policies, he literally tore down the walls of his office to be with us. As he is Italian and as a manager he had to spoke a lot it was not always *that* great, but his move was more than symoblic. It was him who gave the culprit to several of us how to became a senior, a principal engineer or business analyst. He shared, helped and always kept his word.

If I had to name one thing, only one thing that I'm sad about leaving it's that I won't be able to work with him anymore.

Last fall, I decided to join another team dealing with internal security libraries. THe change took place in February. I met great people there and an overly supportive management. I feel a bit of letting them down by leaving so fast after having joined, but I made them understand it's not about them. First, switching companies after 9 years is perfectly normal. Second, joining such a company that i'm joining is a great career move in any case. And finally, money is money.

Human Resources love to brag about what a great place a company is. More than a company, it's almost a family. That people are not motivated by money so much. But it only goes as far. If you let the market pass by by far, you'll have to say bye-bye to more and more people. As an employee, the more you see experienced people departing, the more you'll think you should go with them too.

After all, I'm grateful for these 9 years. I became a developer and I got all the pushes to become one who knows what he does. I became a developer who deeply cares about code quality and sharing with others how to get a better developer. And now I'm ready to move on to my next job. Let's rock, the show must go on!
