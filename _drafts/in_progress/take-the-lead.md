Recently, one of my colleagues told me on chat that he hadn't had yet his yearly performance review. It was due by the end of the previuos month. He was rather suprised, that I actually did. I'm really pushy one one-2-ones and reviews. I made sure that my manager scheduled it before I left on long vacations. When it had to be rescheduled I took care of it.

I told Julien that he should check our manager's calendar and send the invitation.

Wouldn't he be offended? - he asked.

My theory is that managers will not be offended as long as you don't blame them or you don't bring up that you had to do something instead of him.

Managers work a lot. Maybe in some cases their added value is questionable, but they at least spend a lot of time keeping themselves busy.

Your priorities and theirs will be almost all the time different. No surpise here! If your colleague just pops up at your desk asking something and you're not so happy about it, most probably you have different priorities. You want deliver a new feature for the project you work on, while he is trying to investigate some issue related to application monitoring that you don't care at all about - at least not on that week. Your priorities are different.

But it's a bit more subtle with your manager. He needs to complete your performance review. He needs to sign off your training plan. It's just not his top priority to do organization and the preparation.

But you can help her!

Check her calendar and schedule the meeting! Don't forget to include an agenda! [Do you remember? No agenda, no meeting!]()

Likely that she will be happy. You just checked off a couple of tasks of her list.

When I was a university student, I wanted to get a scolarship so I could spend a month at the Europan Parliament as an intern. I needed a couple of recommendations, one from my university. I was thinking for a while and I decided to ask the head of our programme. He sent me a quick reply to my inquiry indicating that he'd have no problem with it, but I should prepare the letter, he just wants to sign it.

I was really suprised.

So that was the first time, but not the last that I had to write my own recommendation.

It is actually very good, because you know why you need, you know what you'd like to have in it. You are in control.

If you can do the same for your training plan, your performance review, don't consider it as [an obstacle. It is the way to go!]() You might get a better review, you might attend better trainings if you can make the proposal.

Write your evaluation, write your plans, prepare whatever you can for the review! And don't forget to communicate it when you send the invitation! Your manager will be even more happy, that she has to prepare less. Of course, don't expect to have everything accepted as is, but you set the tone, you set the baseline.

How to write it is another question

conclusion





If they just have to click on a button, they will be happy.

They will also accept more things than bringin it to the meeting. They don't have  to look smart who makes questiosn ehre and there. They can just wait a bit and accept.

bringing to the meeting vs sending a mail

At least that's my experience.
