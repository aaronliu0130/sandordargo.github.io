MJ DeMarco in his book offers to "crack the code to wealth" so that you can "live rich for a lifetime". Sounds like a clickbait, doesn't it?

Far too often these books are written by people who by all means live a decent life, but that's all, they are from being rich. That's not a problem, nobody _has to_ be rich, but if you write about how to become rich, you'd rather be one.

DeMarco is rich and he became one on his own, he didn't inherit his money.

What he really hates is the become rich slow schemes. Put aside a few bucks every month and by the time you'll need turn to 80, thanks to compound interest, you'll be rich. He doesn't find it appealing, not to say sexy.

It doesn't mean, he doesn't value compound interest, but he says it's not becoming rich. Once you are rich, it's really useful to keep you there in the zone, but it's vitually useless to get there.

He differentiates between 3 types of people.

# The Sidewalkers

They are the average people who don't know a lot about money and regardless of how much they earn they will spend it all. The sidewalkers are the group who don't even have the chance to become rich.

# The Slowlaners

The slowlaners are those who understand they have to put some money aside. They have to put some money aside regularly so that one day they can retire and then they can die in piece and in a relative richess. The problem is that you have to work 5 days a week to get 2 that is yours and the way to riches is not just long, but also not fun and full of frugality.

Most of us are either a sidewalked or a slowlaner. In fact, DeMarco claims that at certain points many slowlaner become a sidewalker because they just got fed up with working hard and saving money for the far future.

# The Fastlaners

They are those who understood the formula of becoming rich.
