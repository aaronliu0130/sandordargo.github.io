In this next part of [the big STL algorithm tutorial](http://sandordargo.com/blog/2019/01/30/stl-algos-intro), we are going to talk about two operations merge on sorted ranges:
<!--more-->

* `merge`
* `inplace_merge`

# `merge`

# Conclusion

This time, we learned about `merge` and `inplace_merge` algorithms. We saw how to merge two sorted containers into one and also how to merge two consecutive sorted ranges into one. 

Next time we'll discover set algorithms.
