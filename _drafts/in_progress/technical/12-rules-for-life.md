Human lives are lived around rules for millennia. You can think about ten commandments to start with, then laws of Hamurappi and in fact all the laws, regulations we have ever had.
<!--more-->
What we do at work are guided by rules we call processes. What we can do in life are controled by laws and moral rules.

There are different systems, somewhere whatever is not allowed is permitted (like in Japan), in other societies anything that is not permitted, is allowed.

The goal is the same. To provide a sytem which helps people living together.

That's something which's usefuless is only questioned by anarchists.

The rest debates about the quantity of rules we need and the rules themselves, but not the necessity of rules.

This book provides 12 maxims that the author, [Jordan Peterson](), thinks everyone should know about.  12 recommendations that can bring a little order to the chaos of our lives. 12 rules that if followed can lead to a life of responsilbibyt, a life of meaning.

A book from one of the most important thinkers on the wolrd stage for many years as the Spectator wrote.

The 12 rules are:
RULE 1 Stand up straight with your shoulders back
RULE 2 Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping
RULE 3 Make friends with people who want the best for you
RULE 4 Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today
RULE 5 Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
RULE 6 Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
RULE 7 Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)
RULE 8 Tell the truth—or, at least, don’t lie
RULE 9 Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don’t
RULE 10 Be precise in your speech
RULE 11 Do not bother children when they are skateboarding
RULE 12 Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street

12 rules are a lot to discuss in an article, probably too much. So I picked only three. I know it could it easily be another set of 3.

- RULE 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping
- RULE 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
- RULE 11: Do not bother children when they are skateboarding

## RULE 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping

While there exists a steretype of developers who hoard information for themselves and do not like to help on others, I think most of us is keen to help.

What is also important to remember that others are not the only people who we should help.

First of all, we should help ourselves. Some others would say we should pay ourselves first. The two rules are a little bit different, but behind we have the same concepts.

If we don't consider ourselves important enough, well, no one will, and on the other hand we will not be able to help the others either.

If a less experienced colleagure makes a mistake, what do we do? We go there laughing at him? Mocking him? Well, maybe a bit of mocking if you are on good terms, but above all, we try to help him overcome the problems.

If you make a mistake what do you do? Are you biting and blaming yourself falling into a vicious cycle or do you try to help yourself to overcome?

Many of us have the tendency to do the former, probably it's easier. But we should focus on the latter approach. Remember, if you work hard, you'll make mistakes. It's okay. Just help yourself by learning from them.

After all, if you help yourself, you'll be able to help others even more.

## RULE 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world

This should evident right?

In case of a problem, before you start fingerpointing at others, you should think about first what you did. Did you do everything possible to avoid that problem? Could you have done something better?

But wait, there is more to it. Before you critize someone else in any circumstances, you should think about wether you did better. You go over to some friends, and you find some dust on the shelf. Don't be critic, but ask yourself whether your house is impeccable.

This doesn't mean that in a code review you shouldn't point out issues. But there are worlds between pointing out problems and critisizing people for making mistakes.

If we follow up on this, we can easily end up on a much wider scale.

Before you'd like to change the society, the world, you must change yourself first. Don't march on the streets, demanding others to change as long as you are not a role model. Be yourself the change! The only way to lead well is to lead by example.

## RULE 11: Do not bother children when they are skateboarding

What? Yes. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding. They are experimenting, they try to find their limits. They strive to get better.

It's healthy. This is what we all need. We people. We developers. While of course, some rules have to be set, we must experiment. We will fail, inevitably. Like Thomas Edison failed a thousand times to ivent the light bulb. It was part of the journey. Failure, making mistakes is part of the course, while it's not self-serving, it should be welcome.

We all are responsible for getting better, we must become strong and autonomous developers. If your afraid such developers, fine. Think about what a week and reliant one is capable of.

Learn, experiment, take [extreme ownership](). Encourage others to do so.


## Conclusion

Jordan Peterson's book is for those who look for a meaningful life and are interested in the thougts of one of the most important thinkers nowadays. While he is a pschiziatrist, he is also a witty writer. He don't give rules, he tells stories from his life, his practice and from science in fact. Some are quite tough and sad. Yet, this is not a book to make you feel bad about your life and society. It's a book about how to stand up straight with your shoulders back and succeed trhough all the adversities you will face.

Happy reading!
