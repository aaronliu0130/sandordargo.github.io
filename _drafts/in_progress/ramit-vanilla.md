Ramit, this question is interesting! Who wanted to get me vanilla?

The first one was my father I think! I'm coming from a family from the suburbs of Budapest, Hungary. My father was a car mechanic/lorry driver and my mother was a florist. I excelled at elementary school and the way to a grammar school and later to the university seemed obvious. I wanted to be a developer - and I became one actually. 

My father did want me to go to a regular high school that gives you a profession. Like a car mechanic or a carpenter, you see. And after getting a decent profession, I might have gone to university. My teachers were outraged. Of course, I would have fitted the suburbian life-plan. Luckily, my mother never approved that plan and she had better plans for me.
