It is difficult. IT is difficult. 

Sometimes you go home and you feel relieved. Finally. You are out of work. Your hours ended and you are out. Now you meet your friends, you go home and read or play or maybe you already have a family waiting for you.

Sometimes when you are out of your home in the morning heading to the office, you are relieved. Finally. You are out of the door. The morning came and you are off to go. Now you go to your office and you can do what you love what you are good at.

If you are particularly lucky, the above cases will be combined. You will be happy to go home at the end of the day and you'll be also happy to leave in the morning to work on your stuff.

But most likely there will be - hopefully short - periods in your life when this combination will be the other way around. You'll be relieved when you leave work, but not for long, because you know you'll have to go home. You'll have to go to the place where you are not happy. And in the morning you will be relieved to step out on the door, you don't have to deal with your crappy thoughts about your miserable life, you will not have to listen to your partner's hysteria nor to the constant cry of your kids who you think are just errors. But as soon as your heading out of your neighbourhood towards to your workplace you realize that your day will not get any better. Maybe the freshly ground coffee will taste well, but it doesn't change that your work sucks. It's repetitive, it doesn't challange you and you constantly feel that you are taken advantage of by your colleagues. 

You are going down on the slope.

What do you think will stop and turn you around? That small beer that you are waiting for at each end of the day will not do any good. Your complaining to your partner and your boss will just let you continue your way down. What can you do?

You have to grab your hair and pull yourself out of misery. But how, you might ask.

When I asked my question, I had no answers.

But I know, I managed to do it a couple of times.

Whenever I felt really stressed by the end of the day, I had to grab a book and open it up and read. By the time I reached home, I was fine.

But this was just a little bit of stress, or just having my brains spinning too fast around work.

But lengthy reads are always helpful.

I had to go a bit deeper, in situations when I was fed up with everything. In those cases, I have to deeply think about what bothers me. Once I know it or them, I have to figure out if I can do anything to make those things better or they are out of my reach and I just have to learn dealing with them. 

Typically, there is something you can do. You must do it. If you don't do it, you'll feel even more depressed because you'll feel that you don't do anything in order to acheive your goals, in order to feel content. If you take action and you succeed, the outcome is predictable. You'll be more than happy. If you fail to improve your situation, you'll still be happier. You will know that you tried what you could. So you go back to the previous step. Is there anything else that you can do? If yes, go and try until you manage to make your situation better or you run our of options. If the latter case hits in, you can still be satisfied. You tried whatever you could to improve something that you didn't like. Congrats. You have to accept that you cannot change everything.

Another thing that usually helps me is doing more exercises. Having walks, going for a run, for a swim, for others going to the gym can be really helpful. Phisical activities will help you to clear the clutter from your head and to improve your mood. If you can perform these physical activities in fresh air, even better for you.

(swap order)

Once your head is more clear and you managed to deal with the rage inside, it's time to talk to someone about the issue. If you can. Having unpleasant conversations are important.



What is my problem right now?

I am tired, that's one thing.

I had to skip one of my pomodoros this morning. That's another thing, I'm unhappy about. I couldn't progress as much as I wanted. 

Is there a third thing? Yes, Mouhcine.

So what can I do about this?

I can go to bed a bit earlier. Let's say by 23:15 latest. And I should go out and run in the morning.

No more Facebook. Just checking the notifications.
