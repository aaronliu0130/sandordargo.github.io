I've already wrote quite a few arcticles about features introduced by C++ 11 and how much it changed how I look at the language. The feature I liked the most probably is the one fo lambda expressions. I don't like them for their sheer existance, it's not _l'art pour l'art_, but it really helps using the different STL algorithms. If you want to get a quick introduction to all the 105, have a look at this video by the owner of fluentcpp.com.

How I write C++ code changed a lot due to the combination of lambdas and STL algos. Yet I know that I don't a lot and I want to improve my knowledge on the STL. What's the best way to learn? Either by doing it or by teaching it. This is why hereby I'm starting to write a series on the STL algorithms.

I don't know yet, how frequently I'll write about them and how many I'll cover in one article, but every second technical article I'll write will be about the STL algorithms - the order of publication is another question.

Let's get started!


Stay tuned!
