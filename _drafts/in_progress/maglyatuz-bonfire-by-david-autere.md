Máglyatűz / Bonfire by David Autere

I'm going to use the Hungarian name, as the book has not been translated yet and there are other books with a similar name in English. Máglyatűz is a political thriller with scenes mostly from Central and Eastern Europe.

While the book is fictional, it has many elements that are true or at least have important connections to the reality. Did arms trafficking took place in Moldova as the author explained? Did attacks against civils in Sarajevo took place for "the bigger good" as the author suggested? I don't know, and I don't even want to suggest. What I know is that I never felt unrealistic that the author wrote.

Who is behind the pen name David Autere anyway? Demkó Attila, Phd has learnt history and theory of politics in the 70s. Later he spent a lot of time studying security policy and wrote his doctoral dissertations about the Irish National Liberation Army. He served Hungary for almost two decases in related fields of the Hungarian Adminsitration.

He knows well the topics he wrote about both concerning the status of Hungarian minorities in the Carpatian bassin and the events of Yugoslav Wars.

While nothing is black and white and you cannot take the book as a proposal, he has a very clear point. What you need is: money, will and tension and then the smallest spark can turn a region into flames. The tension is given around Hungary. Money and will is probably just a matter of time. As the joke says, demand, that there would be...

Since the end of the second world war there was one major event in the Carpatian bassin when Hungarian minorities acted with severe violence, but that was joined even by the Romanian people against Caucescu. Both nations hated the dictator and the state securitz forces more than each other. True that some police officers and other appointed leaders disappeared that time and nobody never heard about them again.

One of the main character says there hasn't been lots of minorities in Europe that achieved not even independence, but at least autonomy without violence. And while violence helped the cause, it's not something that guarantees the right of autonomy. It's worth to point that violence is not - necessarily - about a wide bloodshed, but mostly about keeping the state forces in a constant fear and blocking channels that are vital for sane economy. Most times, when the fight did bring a result to the minorities it arrived through and because of the economic fatigue of the oppressing country.

So what's the way forward for oppressed minorities in Europe? Well. As long as major powers have no interest in guaranteeing democracy for everyone because they fear their own state's integrity, there is no clear way out. But nobody was just given freedom, everyone has to fight for it.
