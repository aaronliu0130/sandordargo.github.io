There is no one true way, that's the feeling I left after performance review recently. In fact, it ended up in a long-discussion with my new manager about ways to work as a team, about ways to improve yourself.

One school says that if you have weak points, you should focus on them to bring them up. You should improve your more fraglie areas so that you become more versatile, you become more balanced in terms of skills.

The other school says that f*ck your weak points. You can of course improve them, but those are your weak points and probably for a reason. Maybe partly because they are not your main areas of interest.

So, instead of raping your interests and mood, try to work on your strong points to become even better in those. To become first class, to reach the top.









I had recently my mid-year review. I had the pleasure of having two managers pulled-in to the meeting. My previous one was seemingly never that much interested in people's management made. He made a good decision and went to the business side from tech. So there was an intermittent period when another manager acted as his stand-in, with whom we defined my goals.

In the meanwhile a couple of weeks ago, the new manager arrived and took us over. He is a first-time manager, but one can tell that he is not the one who was promoted into the role of a manager as there was no better way to value his technical contributions. He grew into his role through his previous assignments, at least that's what  we can feel.

All went well, except for one part. 

There was an evaluation area about innovation. Throughout the year I have to propose a workflow enhancement, process evolution that is adopted by the dev team. Or proposed a product evolution that got studied and integrated into the product plan.

I proposed differnet ways to evolve our development workflow and besides I also proposed a new team structure to deal with our maintenance and monitoring tasks.

For some reason Aochen started to insist on the business side. He thinks that I should focus more on the business evolution.

I gently turned him down. I think to propose business ideas we must have a better understanding of the business, the contracts, in order to see what we can make money from, the business model and these areas are not in my immeadiate interest nor areas I work at on a daily basis.

He kept insisting and cited Luis as an example. Who proposed machine learning. I laughed up and told that machine learning is nothing but a buzzword, it's not an idea. It turned out that the idea he proposed, is not going to be a new product, just might end up a better implementation of something we are developing and besides the whole idea can and what he did can be concluded in one line. Use machine learning here. While interesting, I wouldn't necessarily call it an innovative business idea.

But my goal is not to leszol that idea, just that it's not a great example for an innovative business idea.

We reached to a point where I  realised that basically what he wants me to change my areas of interest.

He nodded. He also added that in business there is not many technical people or who'd be interested in the technical parts and it's the other way around on our side.

Andrea, the manager interrupted and said he has been in this situation all his career and we are going to figure out another way. I didn't get all his points, but....

-was always pushed towards business, but he is technica
- focus on waht you are weak at or at shine at your stronger points?
- different psycho

- why would I be interested in a business I got into and will probably get out
- care about business or do their job?
