The modern Stoic writer Nassim Taleb has a famous epigram: “If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.”

What is a fraud you might ask? [In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) In this post, I consider fraud as a broader concept. Something that includes illegal activities, but much more. A simple lie to yourself or just ignoring a process can make you or me a fraud in my view.

Let's take an example. I want to meet a deadline and I know that I cannot make it unless I skip the steps of testing, refactoring and I deliver legacy code directly. In that case, I'm a fraud if I did it consciously. If I end up doing the same thing, but because of bad practices, it just makes me a bad professional in that case. 

Both are bad things, but I think the former is worse than the latter. If I make a shortcut on purpose and I ignore my values, I ignore the ways I know I should work, it has a meaning that I just don't care enough to do quality work. On the other hand, if I just end up being bad a professional in certain cases and I'm not happy with it, it's something that I can correct in the long run.

You always have to live up to your standards and don't any excuse from yourself to lower your standards.

A more intersting question can be what to do if you see someone else in your team not following the processes you agreed on, if you notice that someone doesn't respect the values your team shares. Can it be that your team doesn't really share values, but someone just stated that these are the common values without having a consesous on them? It might be the case, but that's for another discussion.

According to Taleb if you don't say fraud in such cases, you are a fraud. I think he is right. If you notice a [buddy review]() or if you see that someone doesn't show respect towards the others. You should speak up. How to speak up is yet another question, but any way is better than staying silent. Even if speaking up costs for you. If it costs your job, that's it. Better now than later after the constant confrontation with your values ate you up.

If you see a fraud, say fraud. Otherwise you're just a fraud. Are you a fraud?
