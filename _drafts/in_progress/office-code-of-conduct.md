- write about a very complex spaghetti code you try to memorize
- then Jeferson comes: Hey man, you always look so focused and then he walks by..

You try to refocus, it is that, no no, it's the other way around.

Guy stands in front of your desk. GDB. What;s your goal. But I don't use GDB.

Code of conduct is needed for the office.

When I mentioned this to one of the guys, he said he thinks this will go into the direction of calling for meetings for simple questions. I said no, I just want you to contact me by chat first. It might work, he said.



You're trying to figure out where that bug comes from. Why don't you end up in that execution branch? Is it maybe because that public variable that should have never been public. Maybe it's modified by... But... But... You see from the corner of your left eye that someone is staring at you. You try to keep focused, but he still watching you. He is watching and his mouth is opening to say some words. Finally, you turn there, remove your headphones and try to be quite polite.

"Wow, man. You always look so focused" - and he walks away.

That's it. What the fuck. Someone just interrupted you to say that you look focused.

This is not just a tale or a nightmare. It's actually true and in different ways it happens every day.

[I've been to a time management training recently]() and we were advised to create an office code of conduct. I brought that up at a team retrospective event where the team seemed to really respect my wish not to be disturbed at the desk, but firsdt be contacted by chat. (Chat is not beeping on my computer, so I'm control when I want check it). On the other hand I was also told that maybe others feel differently, so let's talk more about this.

While I respect that people might have different opinions, interruptions are bad for productivity, [that's a fact](). So I went to the next meeting with a small presentation about it is so, what are possible ways to handle interruptions and asked for the team's opinion about it.
