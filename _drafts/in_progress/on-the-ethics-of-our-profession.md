Recently our community started to discuss more about work ethics. Are certain tasks projects ethical or not? Shall we accept unethical tasks? Are we responsible for how our code is used later on?

The thing that bothers me the most that many treat the question of ethics as it was objective and absolute. They say that this and this is not ethical. It would be more appropriate to say that this and this for me are not ethical so I wish not to work on those tasks, I wish not to work for those people.

Many treat their opinion as the one and only one truth, whereas there is no such thing. We come from different backgrounds, and even though we have some shared values, many are different. As such, our opinions on what is ethical or not will be different.

We are developers. We know how to write code. And we have certain other skills. Writing, speaking, etc. We are not philosophers, we are not professional of ethics. To expect us to be able to make profound decisions is not realistic.

But then who should tell us what is ethical? Who tells for the doctors? There is the [Hippocratic Oath](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20909). It provides some guidelines, but it does not say what exactly you should do and you should avoid doing. Hence depending on their values there are doctors who will help the women to control their body, and others who will protect life. Different values, different decisions. 

And just don't try to be someone who claims to know which values are good and which are not. Such behaviour will end dividing communities just like people divide the society.

So what options do we have?

There is an obvious one, to leave everyone decide. We have laws and as long as we obey to those laws, it's fine. This leaves the question of what to do if 99% percent of the people think that working on certain features are non-ethical, but there will be always 1 percent keen to work on it because they simply don't care or they have different values. 

In real life there are laws. And even if you don't like those laws you have to follow them, otherwise you'll be punished. But there are different countries with different laws. It's possible to you to choose a country where you like the laws. You wan't to get right of serious self-defense? You might go to the US. You want to live in a country where you don't have to see gay people parading on the streets? Go to a more conservative country? You want to live somewhere where gay people can adopt children? Yet again, go to a different country. You want to live somewhere where women cannot drive? Go to... One can continue.

Can it be the way for us? We can have groups, guilds of ... And the companies will decide which guilds they prefer? Hm...
