I just finished filling up my kindle with books enough probably for the whole year, when I ran into this book.

I find it difficult at home so I said, this book should pay off fast, if not, well, I don't lose much.

My overall feeling about the book?

I'm one of that person who she talks about the end. I'm horrified by some of the stories and what parents let their children do, how people let their children behave.

I think all these is just taking it easy and not doing the hard work. Not surprised, most people don't do the hard work.

I was always told that I'm a bit smuggish. Yes, I am. But I know who i am, i know what i want, i know my priorities.

Apart from that and that some of the examples are strange to me, I think it's a good book. It's easy to read, it doesn't make you feel bad and it has some practical advice for parents. More about that later.

How to approach angry/sad kids?

How to make them eat?

How to make them cooperative with others.

I think this book is not only good for parents. I think that it can be used with adults as well. I know, I know. But give it a try. THere are a lot of childish people out there. Acknowledge feelings or the way you say they did good...
