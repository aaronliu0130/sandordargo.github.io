The Big Leap! Who doesn't want to take the big leap? I bet there are many. Stepping up always involve some risk and humans in general are more afrais of loss then they are looking for wins.

And there is more that. Even if on the surface you're looking to make your bet and make the big leap towards success, your subconscious might thin differently. Your subconscious mind will do whatever to play your effors down, to not let you achieve your full potential.

Have you ever caught in a fight with your spouse after a business success? Have you ever got sick immeditaly after a big personal win? Have you ever made some big mistakes at the most crucial moments? Mistakes that otherwise you'd never commit.

That's what the authour Gay Hendricls call the *upper limit problem*, the central idea of his book. Your upper limit problem prevents you from living up to your full potential.

The author brings many cases from his own life where he could identify this problem. I bet you can too. I could. Even before reading this book, i had some similar ideas.
