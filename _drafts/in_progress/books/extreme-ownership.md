[Extreme Ownership](https://amzn.to/2sYrJcV) is the legendary leadership book written by two former Navy SEALs, [Jocko Willink](https://twitter.com/jockowillink) and [Leif Babin](https://twitter.com/LeifBabin) who started to teach business about leadership and strategy in their civilian life and also wrote multiple books.

First of all, what is Extreme Ownership? It is about owning your decisions and all their consequences all time, whether your team succeeded or failed. If the team failed, it's your fault and you should not cover yourself with bad excuses. You step up, take ownership for the outcome, you analyze what mistakes led to that situation and make sure it won't happen next time.

As a leader you have to understand that even if a subordinate fails, it's your fault. It's you, who haven't prepared him for the operation/project well enough.

The book is organized about three parts.

The first part focuses on the internal processes, such as taking extreme ownwership of your decisions, or your battle against your [ego, that is your enemy] and you have to let it go. The authors also make the point that there is no bad team, there are only bad leaders supported by an interesting experiment from one of the SEAL training camps.

There were six teams competing against each other in extreme circumstances. There was one team far above the others and another falling always behind. They never won any round and they always quarrelled.

One of the trainers decided to swap leaders between the best and the worst team. While the former best team, still performed well, close to the top, because by that time they all knew how good they were and they could stand up for themselves, the former worst team now with a new already proven leader became the best team. Just by changing the captain. Have I already heard managers saying with arms wide open, what could I have done? I don't have to think that much.

The second part is about the laws of combat.
