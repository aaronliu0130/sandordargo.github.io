Real-World Bug Hunting by Peter Yarowski

check who is him

I wanted to educate myself as someone coordinating security efforst 

how the book looks like

20 chapters

bassics + finding programs + how to write

17 vulnerabilites, which iwll mostly be familier to you if you know owasp top 10

short intro
about different types in general
then analyzes a couple of bug reports, sorted by difficulty
money was not the top factor, he needed understandable, explainable stuff


good book, easy to read due to the examples

i recommend it not just to wannabe hackers, but to any interested in software security
