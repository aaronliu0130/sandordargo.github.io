The Richest Man in Babylon was first published in 1926, almost one hundred years ago. We might think about it as the father of all modern personal finance advice books.

Especially if we consider that it's based on a collection on parables that were written 4,000 years ago in the ancient city of Babylon, the richest city in that world.

They understood some basics correlations that many still get wrong. Now, let's see some of the main ideas.

If you are dedicated you can read the book in an afternoon, it's only about 120 pages and though it's more than what I'm going to share here, I'd only highlight 2 sets of rules and a story.

## Seven cures for a lean purse

When Sargon, the King of Babylon returned from a war, he saw that his people couldn't support themselves.

As a cure, he ordered the richest man in Babylon, Arkad, to teach people how to acquire money.

Arkad gladly accepted the order - I guess it was better than losing his head - and he shared the 7 following rules:

### Start thy purse fattening

No matter how small money you earn, always pay yourself first in a sense that you save its 10% and you don't spend it.

### Control thy expenditures

It really comes from the previous point that you should not spend more than what you have. In fact, you should not spend more than 90% of your income. This is so easy, but if you just think about all the consumer credits, so many people don't get it right.

And there is another thought that is worth to ponder on:

> *"Confuse not the necessary expenses with thy desires."*

Yes, we want many things, but that's not our necessities. It's not necessary to have the latest smart phone, to have take-away lunches or even to live in a relatively spacous apartment. It's good if you can afford that, but don't spend more than you have...

### Make thy gold multiply
### Guard thy treasures from loss
### Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment
### Insure a future income
### Increase thy ability to earn

## The five laws of gold

## Having strong work ethics is the most important
