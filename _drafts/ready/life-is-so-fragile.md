Not a lot of people who I know practice the Stoic exercise of [premeditatio malorum](https://dailystoic.com/premeditatio-malorum/). It is about imagining things that could go wrong or be taken away from us. Its main purpose is to prepare us for the inevitable bad things that will happen in our life.

Even when people are dying in wars or in terrorist attacks right around you, you tend __NOT__ to think about how easily your life can be taken away. You forget to look around before stepping down at the crosswalk and that's it: you are dead. Or maybe you ate a wrong combination of different exotic foods? No luck, a one-way ticket to the hereafter is issued.

Even before I knew about Stoicism, I used to follow resembling practices. I imagined negative life-changing events, loss of family members - especially in case of an on-going illness. My personal experience is that premeditatio malorum helped me to accept the immediate sorrowful events, but I don't feel it helped me to process them in the long run. I think it was because usually, I envisaged how I would react in case of bad events, not how I would live with them. That's something I should change in my practices.

When my first child was born, with my wife, we were afraid of everything concerning the baby. What happens if we let her fall, what happens if we leave her alone if we hold her too tight. What happens if she gets sick? Obviously, nothing irreversible happened, our fears were completely irrealistic.

My daughter is a strong little creature, she was barely even sick during her 28 months. Some small colds, stomach bugs, but nothing serious.

We expected our second child with much less fear and worry.

While in my home country you barely bring out the babies in their first - few - months, here in France it's not the case at all, so we went out with him already starting from the beginning of the third week. When we went to the first doctor's visit after 18 days, our paediatrician started to explain to us that during this time he should have gained like 300-400 grams - my son, not the doctor. Then he measured my son and the gain was almost a thousand. Impressive little wrestler. 

Everything went well until one day he cried even more than it's acceptable by a newborn and his body was hotter than usual. As the weather was really hot, we were not sure where that hotness was coming from. Anyway, the thermometer didn't show an outstanding value, just a bit higher than usual. By the evening the air chilled down, but his temperature went up to around 39 degrees. My wife took him to the hospital during the night, while I stayed home with our daughter.

Next evening I was holding him in my hands still crying. The personnel had no idea what kind of illness he got, all they knew was that they had not been able to soothe his fever.

I was standing there with my son fighting with a disease that nobody recognized and I was thinking how fragile life is and how incapable we are protecting it.

Now I don't want to exaggerate at this point. I was not desperately worrying about losing my son. But I felt the cold breath of death in a different way than any time before in my life. It's completely different to see an old, or even a middle-aged person dying than watching a young body toiling, groaning and fighting.

What do I want to tell with this post you might ask?

I don't just want to release my stress, but I want to stress, I want you to keep in mind, that life is extremely fragile and don't take it as if granted. You can lose your life or a loved one anytime, even if in reality those will be rare - hopefully. And well, most of us die only once.

Thinking about bad things is not pessimism. Bad events are natural part of life, good memories cannot exist without grieving moments. You'd better trained yourself for them. The preparation you put into it will weaken the shock you'll face once fate knocks on your door to take something or someone away.

Soon I'll write about how you can use premeditatio malorum within your projects.

Until then, __[memento mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori)__!
