Practising Stoic philosophy is more difficult than writing or thinking about it. Besides its purpose is to use it, to live by its principles in everyday life instead of just intellectualizing about it.

Imagine the following situation. You join a new team that you already knew but didn't work with them. The team has quite few members and one is just a burden for the rest. Not because he is lowly skilled, but because he just doesn't care. He already gave his notice, yet he has had to stay for almost three months. He doesn't give a shit anymore. In fact, he didn't give a shit by the time he decided to look for another job. He doesn't give a shit either about his job, his professional pride nor about letting his teammates down. The time when he got fed up maybe management could have taken actions either way even though the country's laws are protecting the employees too much. Some team members say that he hadn't given a shit before either. That's a lot of shit.

How should you think about such a situation as someone who is practising Stoicism? On the one hand, do you have anything to do with this situation? You should do your job, that's it. If other people don't work, that's not your business. If you saw this situation from the outside, it wouldn't matter to you, but since you are inside you might care for multiple reasons. One reason is that you don't like free riders - anywhere in life -, the other is more practical. It has an effect on the output of your team.

If you accept that you shouldn't just __not care__ then following the Stoic thoughts, you should try to change what you can and accept what is not in your means.

So if you are working in the same team with such a guy and you don't want to accept the situation in the first place, you can try to raise the point to the guy. But most probably it won't work. Then you might talk to the management. Maybe they will have an idea. Maybe not. You did something. Probably the management cannot do anything because they have no power anymore. So either you accept the situation now or you think about something you can do.

But what can you do? You can try to ask unpleasant questions at every available occasion. Especially at daily standups. Maybe it will start becoming too embarrassing for him trying to hide his idleness. You can try to call him out in public at team meetings. Again, just to make him feel that the environment around him is becoming too unfriendly. Ultimately, you might mention to him that it would be really a pity if his next employer would find out about his working morale.

There are some threats for you though. On the one hand you try to avoid that this doing nothing behaviour becomes acceptable, but on the other hand, you might turn the whole team's ambience toxic. You might give an impression that you are too demanding whereas what you want is not more than let's say a 50% effort from someone who is leaving. And if you just mention the possibility of letting his next employer know about how he was behaving, you might become someone who is threatening other people. You certainly want to avoid that.

So what to do? If I were in this situation I would certainly ask for the help of management and I'd also ask more questions at standups/status meetings. Would I call him out in front of a team? Certainly. Once, at least. If nothing happens, I'm not sure if it's worth to repeat it.

Have you been there?
