A couple of months ago I read [Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad](). The author who is a rich businessman tells about his life and what he learnt from his real poor father and the rich father of his friend about how to run business, how to make money. The pieces of advice are quite unortodox, but they are worth to think about.

In terms of business, he focuses quite on real estate business.

Recently I came across one of his tweets, in which he complains how his editor removed long parts of the book which was about penny stock trading. He also said he fired that editor. That I can understand. Though I don't understand how can your book going to print without you having it validated thoroughly. Well. I'm a developer. I see how things go to production from time to time. Maybe I do understand.

As this was a [free downloadable book](https://af-lifetime-income.com/stolen-stories-rich-dad-poor-dad/), I didn't hesitate to read it.

It has two parts. The first part is written by [Kiyosaki](https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosak). There are a few stories about investment in general, then quite some details and explanation about Small-Cap Stocks.

The second part of the book is written by [Timothy Skyes](https://twitter.com/timothysykes) about pennystock trading who is guess what, a pennystock trader. What are pennystocks? Actions which are not worth more than 10$. Skyes goes into little details about pennystock trading and if you are interested in that world, the book is for you! But if you don't care at all about trading and stocks, you'll find it boring. While the original [Rich Dad, Poor Dad](https://amzn.to/2oP04FK) book can be interesting for everyone who has to manage his finances, this one might be rather boring for most. Except for the first couple of pages. But again, if you are interested in the world of puts and options, go for it. Anyway it's not a long book and it's for free. You won't feel loosing money if you put it down after 15 minutes.
