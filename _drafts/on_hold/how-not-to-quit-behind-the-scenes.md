Mouhcine was with the company for three years. Some time ago he became demotivated. He thought there was not enough development around and he couldn't progress in his career. He couldn't get the promotion he wished for. This was the most demotivating point for him.

In many aspects he was like the type who I wrote about [here](). He complained that there is not enough development, but what he did, he didn't do it well.

He was not a Stahanovist, that's for sure. Even a year ago, some people complained that he is not working enough. He came late, left early and he smoked a lot. Sometimes he went to sleep in his car. He also enjoyed a lot playing in the browser.

At one point he decided to leave the company. Then he got a job offer from a bank where he could use his favourite language - Python. In Europe, notice periods are quite long. In his particular case it was three months and the company didn't want to let him go, but somehow they managed to reach an agreement of about two months.

He didn't do much even before, but he basically stopped working, and even with the tasks he got he was blackmailing the team. He said that he wants to work on Python, so he wants to get the one user story on that. He got it. He wrote such a low quality script that I didn't even undestand how Python can be his favourite language. I mean if you claim that something is your favourite, I assume you know it well. He complained for days that processing the data takes too much time. Once I had the time, I checked the script and started to make some measurements, why it takes indeed hell of a lot time. In about half an hour, the script gained an increase of 2 orders of magnitude. Python's `re` module was misused, instead of `search` I started to use `match`. More about a similiar issue [here]().

Knowing that he is leaving the company, I asked him if he thinks that it makes sense to have him in the Scrum team with a 100% velocity. He told me that as we started to use story points instead of mandays, it's fine. We'll just deliver less, we are hardly accountable for days. 

What the fuck. 

Then I made a big mistake. I didn't push the reduction through.

During the next sprint he continued to work on the Python stuff. Basically he did nothing for a week, but he retrieved some logs and run the tool. A well trained monkey might be able to do this.

Yet, I couldn't really find a way to complain at the daily, he spoke so much at every occasion detailing whom he worked with, how he used the tool, etc. Even though, I tried to ask some cumbersome questions.

Then after four days, on Friday he said he might take another story that afternoon. And he did. I sent some diffs to him, so that he can see how we did the same thing for another component.

Two days later another dev came back from vacation. He didn't know some of our flows wel enough, and he implemented 90% of what Mouhcine should have done in his user story. Obviously, Gergely sent the diff to Mouhcine. He should added a couple of lines. Less than 10, I think. More close to two in fact. He didn't do it.

I wanted him to take a monitoring role from Gergely for the next week as we needed more resources for the last week. I convinced Gergely to propose the change to him. He refused. Even though as a monitoring guy, it's easy to find "free time". Although it's true that you must do something too... So he refused. I had to ask our manager to impose that change. He quickly agreed to do it.

We learnt next Tuesday that he did exactly nothing for the user story. I asked him a couple times to create a pull request even if he was not ready, but he just didn't do it. In fact, it was not a suprise.

The manager who keeps an eye on the Scrum Team asked who can work on it. Neither me or Gergely had time, we had to finish ours. That afternoon, Aochen almost completed the user story in 30 minutes. Including cloning and creating the pull request. He came to my desk and with his usual big smile he told me that was really pissed off. I knew. Everyone was.

By the way that afternoon I involved our Senior Manager. I explained the situation to him including what I tried to do before coming to him and I asked for some help. He invited Aochen in and we discussed the situation. 

The next couple of days he did more work that I saw from him in 6 months. Yet, he didn't do a lot of things. In fact, he did irritatingly few. 

But we removed him from the scrum capacity, so he was not causing immediate harm to the team. Fair enough.
