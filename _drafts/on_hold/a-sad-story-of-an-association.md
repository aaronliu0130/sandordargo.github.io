We are all different. 

Some people when move to a new country will look for the company of his/her compatriots. Some others will do anything in order to avoid them. What does this depend on?

I don't know.

Maybe on experience with people in general. Maybe it depends on the stereotypes you have against your own people.

But maybe I'm completely wrong and it's just in your genes, fate, whatsoever. 

In the end, it doesn't matter.

I'm not a people's person. If I make serious efforts I seem like I am, but that's just faking.

If I could I would stay alone most of the time with my computer, with my books or just simple alone walking in a forest. My family or some of the very closest friends sometimes could join me. 

On th other hand, with these limitations it is very difficult to progress in life like that.

Still, a couple years after changing countries, I can say that it was a very good step for me in order to make my social life less of a burden.

Yet, after a couple of months, I ended up being Santa Claus at the Christmas celebration of the local Hungarian association. How that happened? I don't remember exactly. But I tried to perfect my act. I even changed shoes and glasses between the kid's part and the party. With my wife we did what we could to prepare a gift for the kids that was in budget and was as healthy, yet as pleasant for the kids as possible.

We were enthusiastic about the kids and about the association too. So we joined, we paid the membership fees for the next year. That was the first and the last time that we paid for it.

As the months passed and we visited more and more events certain things became more and more strange, yet evident.

Most of the programs were kids oriented, we had none that time. The president had two. There was no event organized only for adults or for young adults, even though there would have been a need for it. But not from the president.

Selling your flat is always difficult. I don't mean one flat of many you might own, but _your_ flat, your home, the place where you live. The place where you eat together with your family. Where you walk up and down with your crying kid in your arms. The place where you go home after work and your children run to you and hug your knees as they see you again at the end of the day. I mean selling your _home_.

Jean-Paul and his wife made their choice. After a couple of years living in their nicely renovated home, they decided to sell it and move on to create another one that will fit more their updated requirements. Jean-Paul is a baker working long hours from the early morning and his wife Marie also works in the food industry, but in a more relaxed part of it. She is a secretary of a small company working with yachts. They supply these luxirious ships with food that you just dream about.

None of these jobs will make anyone wealthy, but at least in France they will grant anyone a decent life who doesn't throw their money simply out of the window. Marie and Jean-Paul had a decent, relaxed life with regular vacations and with some savings on the side.

Their third child was to be expected in a couple of months. They decided to take a load so that they can move to a bigger flat. They found it important to give all the kids some space, and they don't have to make a difference among them by giving one kid an own room, while the other two have to share. 

Even though a newborn doesn't require an own room, a few months after Denis will be born, it will be awesome for the kids. 

And during those first couple of months while the room would be empty, it will be great for the visiting and helping family members and for some friends to stay in, instead of using the couch on the living room.

About a week after they advertised their flat through an agent, they received their first call. A family of four would visit their home. As the agent knew the husband from school, he could desribe them to the seller. The husband is a well-established software engineer. Not the shy and introverted one well described by the stereotypes, but someone who is not afraid of managing projects and speaking in from of others either. He has a wife from a Central-European country, who understand French and speaks it good enough not to be sold on the market. She works as a nanny in kindergarden. They also have two children, one 9 and one 6 years old.

It was a rainy day. Not so usual on the Cote d'Azur, but the climate is changing. This year it's been raining a lot and while the weather in the North of Europe is much hotter than used to be, on the Cote d'Azur the changing climate meant a lot of water pouring down from the sky.

It was a day when Jean-Paul and Marie could have gone for a walk anyway, so it was ideal to have the first visitors. Or wasn't it? Maybe people act in a more positive way when even the sun is shining. While Jean-Paul was thinking about this, the bell was ringing.

The family arrived.

Didn't leave their shoes at the hall. Smaller kid was climbing up the sofa with the muddy shoes. 

Kid was eating. The other wanted. 

Hesitating parent. It's not normal. But potential buyers. The mother, with a really bad french wanted for her kid. She more demanded than asked.

One kid was hisztis. The other one more shy.

The husband acted exactly as if hr doesn't even feel the world around.


Embarrassed agent. Didn't shwo any again.

The buyers. They didn't buy. Did they have the money? Who knows...

The owners. Were. Schocked. They moved on.
