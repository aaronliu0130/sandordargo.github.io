Recently, a day before a [sprint review]() our scrum team quickly met to decide who will present each of the user stories. By the end of that ad-hoc meeting, my scrum master realized that I wouldn't present anything. To me it was not an issue, that sprint I did't work on almost anything in scope of the scrum. Personally, I'd see no point in presenting something I didn't directly contribute to.

The discussion continued among three of us - the scrum master, another - like me - quite new member of the team, and myself.

According to our scrum master, every time, everyone should present something. Why you might ask? Because we are a team and we used to work like that. (_Half of the team got replaced during the last couple of months._)

On my side, I explained, I don't think that having everyone presenting has anything to do with working as a team. I believe in [meritocracy]() and I think that if you worked on something, you merit and you should take the pride to present it. Not just because you deserve to share what you delivered, but because I find it unfortunate that not the most knowledgeable person present a story to the stakeholders. A random Joe most of the time cannot answer the questions the same way as the people who worked on a story could.

I don't think we should potentially lower the quality of our presentations on purpose. Of course, it might be that you have an outstanding orator who would even sell a one-liner fix as a complete new shiny release to your stakeholders in a 3 minutes short presentation. But our scrum master didn't say that our best public speaker should present during the whole demo, but that we should shuffle the stories among us, so that everyone can present - _like we used to do_.

His main reasons are:
* In a team, everybody contributes so we should make it visible to our stakeholders
* People might get demotivated if they cannot present, if they cannot get visibility
* Maybe a more experienced person will implement most of the interesting user stories, yet other people should also present engaging topics
* People might want to improve their presentation skills
* If you work for your own, if you are not a team player, it's fine to present what you did, but if you are a team, it shouldn't matter.

As you might have guessed, I don't agree with him - and he knows that, he even proofread this article, so that I don't misinterpret his words. Let's check each of those points.

Normally, in a team everyone contributes. True. If that's the case, I'm convinced that everyone will have the chance to share his or her contribution without shuffling stories. If you couldn't contribute in a sprint or two. Fine, the world will not collapse. You didn't contribute maybe because you were sick, you were on vacation or because you were asked to work on something else. But if you're not contributing for a long period, most probably there is a problem. The team shouldn't try to hide that problem as a form of _camaraderie_. Problems must be solved, otherwise they cause even more and deeper issues. Of course, shuffling stories and making presenting everyone seems pretty handy for free-riders. Don't help them.

I don't think that anyone would be demotivated because they cannot present someone else's work. If I'm mistaken, maybe those people should look for another profession. Not because they are bad developers, maybe they are great. But if this causes them a problem, they might be, might be good salespeople, spokespersons or politicians. Those jobs are important and must be done with care.

On the other hand, developers of any kind might be pretty disappointed if they never can work on interesting tasks for any reasons. If you cannot start working on an interesting story because more experienced people took them that's something a team should be able to deal with.

As I stated, I think it's beneficial and fair if people who delivered something would present that to the stakeholders.

On the other hand, a team should be and most probably is a mixture of highly experienced members and junior developers. It's fine. What is not fine, if you don't give enough possbility for juniors to grow. Little-by-little they should be involved in more complex user stories. And as soon as they work on one and if they feel like, they can get the possibility to present the full story.

People shouldn't present something just because the sake presenting, but they should be given the chance to do something that is worth the attention of every stakeholder!

If you want to work on your presentation skills, maybe having your 5-10 minutes in the limelight is worth something, but not that much actually. If you really want to get better, schedule a knowledge sharing session with your team, prepare a topic and present it. You can ask some more experienced presenters from the team to keep an extra eye on the way you deliver the presentation and give you an honest feedback. If somenoe asked me, I'd do it with pleasure. Or better yet, check [Toastmasters.org](https://www.toastmasters.org/find-a-club "Fine a club near you"), find a nearby group and join them. That was the simple best thing I did in order to get rid of my fear of public speaking.

We used to work like that is a really poor reason to me, but I don't want to deep on this topic, [others already did it better](https://www.mapconsulting.com/blog/leadership-and-management/the-truth-behind-the-phrase-we-have-always-done-it-that-way) than I could in the scope of this article.

But that's just my opinion, everyone is free to have his or her own.

How do you deal with the project presentations in your team?
