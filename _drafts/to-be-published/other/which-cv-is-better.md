I'm still not looking for a new job, but after having met some people and having received a couple of interesting propositions I realized that I don't even have a CV. The latest version I had is 6 years old, something that I used for getting my actual job. Since then I've been eagerly updating my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandor-dargo/) to document what I've done, but even though I enjoy reading articles on the topic I never actually refreshed my CV.

I knew that what I'd want is a single page resume and that I'd like to focus on my achievements, not what I have done. The same time, I also remembered a couple of things what [Yegor](https://twitter.com/yegor256) wrote in his 2 cents about how to [pimp up a resume](https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html).

I know that he doesn't a value a lot the company where you _"managed to occupy a seat"_, he is interested in about what you do. That's good but I still thought that combining the owners of my chairs and what I've done at those places has a value. Especially given that most of my professional activity is related to my workplace and we don't do a lot of open source code, at least not in my team.

At the same time, I wanted to include some links to my most interesting profiles, a list of skills gropued by my level of expertise and as I've started to apply for conferences and plan to keep doing so, my public speaking experiecnce.

For my previous position I managed to put in some numbers as achievements, but not yet for my current job. We lack of some statistics, I went with using strong verbs for the moment. Anyways, this is what I came up with:

![My Original CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cv-sandor-dargo-2019-original.jpg "My Original CV")

I sent it to Yegor, as I was interested in his opinion. He told me that he liked the layout, but he would have preferred to read more about what I do, who I am and less about the places where "I managed to occupy a seat". Meaning that I should move my jobs to left part and put my skills and interests to the middle.

It felt strange. Okay, to be perfectly honest, it still does. But on the other hand, I realized that I have more techincal skills to add, so I could update the previous version too (that's what I included above).

I came up with the below resume. Yegor liked it so much that it even made it to his artciles on CVs.

What do you think? Which one do you prefer?
