I'm not sure what you think about when you read the title [My Different Orient](https://amzn.to/2WcMX0H), especially nowadays. But there is nothing special here. Orient here mostly refers to the East. This book is the story of a German guy who left his country quite early in his life to build his resume in the hospitality industry.

He went from hotel to hotel, from country to country until at a beach holiday village he found the love of his life and soon he went on founding his own business.

I've never had a business, but I think it's quite usual that your first one fails. It was not the case for the author, but he dreamt bigger and failed. He temporarily lost his love and through booze, it almost cost his life.

He stood up, left the village where his partner and son lived to pull himself together and to make some money. Then he almost made the same mistake by starting to build a new business where he couldn't rely on anyone and didn't delegate. Then he realized he's in the same shoes as before.

Then he took his family and back to Germany so his son could have a better education. In a nutshell, this is Dietmar Vogelmann's story. It is not very exciting, he is not a writer, yet his style is enjoyable and he sounds utterly honest. This is the biggest value of his book. He shows his struggles, he doesn't look for excuses and confesses many mistakes he made.

His reasoning at certain points sounds a bit awkward and to me makes little sense, but that's not the point. We are all different, we shouldn't judge. In fact, that's the point, even if it sounds awkward that he felt like his business was his child while he literally left his child, he is not afraid to write it down. This honesty always has value.

You might read [this book](https://amzn.to/2WcMX0H) during lunch breaks if you are looking for something easy, but honest read.
