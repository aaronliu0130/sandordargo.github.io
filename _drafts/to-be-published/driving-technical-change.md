If you don't have initiatives, if you don't like to nor want to change the status quo, if you don't believe that you can or should have an impact this is not your book.

[Driving Technical Change](https://amzn.to/2IPVUZh) is a book for the rest. For those who likes to stand up and take the lead, for those who have ideas, for those who don't believe that something should be done in a way just because it's been like that.

If you are such a person, you know that it's not enough to have ideas. You will face apathy at best, but more probably resistance. You need perseverance, but it's not enough. It makes no good repeating the old bad patterns and alienating friends and colleagues. You need understanding, techniques, strategies. Then you can go out and practice to change your world, that is - just remember! - others' world too. That's the point.

[Driving Technical Change](https://amzn.to/2IPVUZh) helps you learn how to take the initiative.

First, it describes the different kinds of resistance you'll face. You'll learn that most people are _Time Crunched_, already too busy, sometimes too busy for improvements. It's not impossible to turn them around!

The _Uninformed_ and the _Herd_ are relatively easy to deal with. They need information and leadership. And you are there to provide them with all of that. But beware, sharing information and being a leader come with great responsibility!

The _Burned_ and the _Cynic_ are more difficult to work with, but yet the book will provide some stories and strategies to help you deal with them.

The _Boss_ is the boss. You should communicate with her in her language, not yours, and your chances are good. If your cause makes sense, of course. In her language.

However, even this book doesn't offer a lot with regards to the _Irrational_. They are simply irrational. The best thing is to avoid them as long as possible.

Once you understood who you'll have to deal with, you'll be handed 9 different techniques to work with them. But whatever you do, the most important message is that solving a problem and pushing for a solution are two different things. You have to make sure that the problem you see does really exist and you have to be flexible. Your solution might not be the only one and it might not be the best.

Whatever techniques you'll choose to work with, you have to keep in mind the way that you should follow in almost all cases.

You are not a lone wolf. You'll need associates.

As I already mentioned, first you will have to __ignore__ everyone who is __hostile__. Hostility just reproduces itself and that's the last thing, you'd need.

You will have to __target__ first __the willing__ who are likely to adopt the changes you push for.

Then you have to __harness the converted__, meaning that they should not only accept the solution you propose, but they should also support you in your quest to make it accepted by the organization. With them, you will not be alone!

And once the size of the supporters' group is growing, you should finally __convince the management__ to accept your proposal.

Is it that simple? Yes. Is it easy? No, as even the author admits. But [Driving Technical Change](https://amzn.to/2IPVUZh) gives you a hand to make it easier.

Happy reading!










how to get your battling avarage up

is about patterns

skeptic patterns - reason people who resist
counter skeptics

to avoid evil polictics

professional development to skeptics

solving a problem vs pushing a solution

is there really a problem?
what is the audiene perspective?

=>

more custom fit!


ynics about one technology are often Burned on other technologies. This is a good thing; most of the skeptic patterns have overlapping techniques for overcoming them.

Most people are a little Time Crunched.

The Uninformed
they didn't know they have that problem
maybe they don't care, but maybe it's just the tremendous quantity of information. don't judge
bring 'em the mountain 

First the good news: it is extremely easy to change the Uninformed to another one of the resistance patterns. All you have to do is tell them about it—BOOM, they’re no longer uninformed. The bad news: they are more likely to become one of the other skeptic patterns than they are to become converted.
Demonstrate the Technique,

The Herd
 “I’m allowed to do that? I wanted to, but I didn’t think you all would let me.”
 followers not leards
 1) they don't know they can lead
 2) have other prios
 they want to be led

The Cynic
more important than being smart is looking smart
"but in front of a crowd, you’ll have unknown variables, nervousness, and often bad luck keeping you from your full potential" - it's almost never bad luck. you are just not prepared enough
learn to differentiate between critisism and the cynic

don;t allow them to look smart at your expense


The Burned

The TIme Crnuched
There’s never time to do it right, but there’s time to do it twice.”
easy if industry is ciclycal

maybe the project is worthless after deadline

The Boss
you'r baby is killed when you speak in professional terms
THEY DON"T UNDERSTAND. IT"S THAT SIMEPLE

The Irrational
burned and time crunched - some premises which are rational (not necessarily right)
irrational oremise

The Irrational jump in to an argument, they pretend to be another skeptic type, and if their arguments are defeated, they change arguments and even the skeptic type they seem to be.

don't convince them, contain them (bribe, punush, compel)

# Gain expertise
don't have to be expert, but you have to push for the next level


So, keep that in mind for both encouragement and humility. An expert who isn’t growing isn’t an expert, because growing is what makes you an expert.

cynics are broad but not deep


don't forece peopleto use it before you learnt it

don't patronize or bully


# Deliver your message

packaging matters, message matters
BE PASSIONATE, DON’T BE ZEALOUS

don'tspeak about absolutes, think about useases

Like a political campaign, going negative is a sign of weakness. Saying the competition is no good is a bad argument. Saying your tool is better than the competition is an improvement. Saying a solution will make your fellow developer’s day more productive without qualifying it is the best way to sell it.

What you say is less important than how you say it. The other important takeaway is, What you say matters less than what they hear. 

# Demonstrate Your Technique

SHOW DON'T TELL

People believe what they are shown more than what they are told. 

can be good against the rationals


# Propose Compromise
find a rule that everyone hates
ripe for change

needs likeminden people and power to overturn rules
not broadly applicalble


# Create Trust

difficult of course
dont lie

admit if you are wwong. few people do it. itspowerful


# Get Publicity

for your own developed tools and techniques


# Focus on Synergy
business drives business, not tech drives it

situational either their is a situation or there is not

# build a bridge
not the ultimate solution, but you want but better than what you have
change is hard, big is harder, little is easier

no TDD, but UT first

either find or build a bridge

# Create Some Compelling
you have to create that something
fix pain points





Ignore the Hostile

Target the Willing

Harness the Converted

Convince Management


# Ignore the Irrational


The key here is to try to think of the Irrational as an obstacle and not an enemy. Enemies are defeated; obstacles are overcome. Overcoming an obstacle can be as easy as walking around it.

# Target the Willing
quantity over quality
easy << hard < harder
easy
uninformed, herd

hard
bunred
time crunched

#Harness the converts

cross promote, first theirs then yours

#Swya the management

solve your bosses problem, not your own

without vigilance, mandate is useless. track and monitor

# Final thoughsts
needs time
own your failures

you always have to start over
