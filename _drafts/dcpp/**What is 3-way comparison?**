**What is 3-way comparison?**

The three-way comparison operator is also known as the starship operator and it looks like this: `lhs <=> rhs`.

It helps to decide which oparand is greater, lesser or whteher they are equal.

If you ever implemented comparison operators in C++, you know what a menial, tedious task it is. You have to define six operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`).

With C++20, you can simply `=default` the spaceship operator and it will generate all the six `constexpr` and `noexcept` operators for you and they perform lexicographical comparison.

For the exact rules on the supported types, check [CppReference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_comparison).
