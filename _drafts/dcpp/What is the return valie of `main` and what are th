What is the return valie of `main` and what are the available signatures?

Though in some cases you might see `void`, it is not correct. The return type of the `main` function of a C++ program is `int`.

If the program finishes successfully `main` returns `0`, otherwise a non-zero number. Based on this return type the OS knows if the program succeeded or not. Though there is no standard on what different integer values would mean.

Even though the return type of `main` is `int`, in this case a `return` can be omitted and it will be automatically treated as `0`, so it will be considered a succesful return.

Main has two valid signatures:
- `int main()` where there is no arguments passed in
- `int main(int argc, char **argv)` or equivalent such as `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`

In this latter case, `argc` represents the number of command line arguments passed in to C++ and in `argv` you can find the program name and the arguments. When `argc` is bigger than 0, argv[0] will be the program name and the rest is the program name.

As an example, if you execute: `./myProg foo bar 'b a z'`, `argc` will be 3 and `argv` will be `["myProg", "foo", "bar", "b a z"]`.
