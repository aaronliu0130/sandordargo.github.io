**How many `return` statements should you have in a function?**

While some would insist that you should only have one return statement for better understandibility, it's counter-productive.

It's true that with multiple return statements you'll have multiple exit points that you have to consider when you try to understand what a function does. But this is only a problem, if your function is too big. If you write short functions, let's say what fits a screen (use a nice, big font size) then this is not a problem.

Besides, with multiple return statements, it's easy to create some guards on top of the function:

```
void foo(MyClass* iMyClass) {
  if (iMyClass == nullptr) {
    return; 
  }
  // do stuff
}
```

With multiple return statemetns, you can avoid unnecessarily convoluted code and the introduction of extra state variables.
