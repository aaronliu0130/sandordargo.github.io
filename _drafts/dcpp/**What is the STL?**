**What is the STL?**

STL stands for the Standard Template Library, but there is no such library as the STL. It is part of the C++ standard library.

It's a set of template classes and functions to provide solutions for common problems. The elements of the STL can be divided into 4 categories:

- algorithms, e.g.: `std::find`, `std::copy`
- containers, e.g.: `std::vector<T>`, `std::list<T>` 
- function objects, e.g.: `std::greater<T>`, `std::logical_and<T>`
- iterators, e.g.: `std::iterator`, `std::back_inserter`

The STL was created by Alexander Stepanov, who already had the idea of a generic data processing library in the 1970s, but there was no language support to implement his dream.

In the 80s, he made his first attempts in ADA, but that language never got widely adopted outside the defense industry.

A former colleague convinced him to present the idea to the C++ Committee that he did in November, 1993. Then things happened fast. In March, 1994 Stepanov submitted the formal proposal which was accepted in just a mere 4 months. In August, HP - the employer of Stepanov - published the first implementation of the STL.
