## Books I wrote

So far there is only one finished, but rest assured, more are coming.

### [How to use const in C++: On the virtues of constness](https://leanpub.com/cppconst/)

![How to use const in C++ cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cpp-const-cover.jpg){:height="66%" width="66%"}

Constness is such an important idea that in certain languages entities are `const`, in other words, immutable by default. If you want to become a seasoned C++ developer, you must understand how you can use `const` correctly. In this book, you'll learn when and how to use it in the different contexts it might appear:

- `const` functions
- `const` local variables
- `const` member variables
- `const` return types
- `const` parameters

## Books I recommend

I consider reading as a primary necessity of humans, just like eating. I'd like to help you to choose the good reads easier.
