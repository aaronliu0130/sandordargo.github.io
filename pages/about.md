... my name is Sandor. I work as a C++ developer, but I'm also enthusiastic about Python. Before I became a software developer, I was on the dark side. No, I have never been a manager, I meant operations.

I was a DBA in one of the most process-oriented corporations (according to NY Times), but I wanted more freedom and creativity. The more time I've spent on coding, the more I realized how much fun it is and how much I love high-quality code - and how far I am from it!

When I'm not on the road with my family, or not baking something in the kitchen, I read and write. I write mostly about the books I read, the importance of Stoic philosophy, and of course, C++.
