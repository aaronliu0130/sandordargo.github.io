I am a software craftsman whose biggest passion is continuous learning. After working as a database administrator for one of the most process-oriented corporations, I changed jobs and countries to become a software developer. The more time I've spent on coding, the more I realized how much fun it is and how much I love high-quality code.

A few years ago I joined the craftsmanship community in Amadeus which was the best thing that could happen to me. It's an endless source of new experiences and learning. It's also a place to meet great people from who I can learn or sometimes who I can teach. It helps me to pursue my goal of delivering clean code.

This page serves as a tool to share some of my experiences mostly about IT.
