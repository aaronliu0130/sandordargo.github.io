I"~<p>I’m still not looking for a new job, and - given the circumstances - luckily I don’t even have to. Still, after having met some people and having received a couple of interesting propositions I realized that I didn’t even have a CV. The latest version I had was 7 years old, something that I used for getting my actual job. Since then I’ve been eagerly updating my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandor-dargo/">Linkedin profile</a> to document what I’ve done, but even though I enjoy reading articles about how to craft high-quality resumés I never actually refreshed my CV.

<p>I knew exactly that I’d want a single page resumé and that I’d like to focus on what I have achieved, not what I have done. At the same time, I also remembered a couple of things that <a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256">Yegor</a> wrote in his 2 cents on how to <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/2016/03/08/pimp-up-your-resume.html">pimp up a resumé</a>.</p>

<p>I know that this thought-provoking guy doesn’t value a lot the company where you <em>“managed to occupy a seat”</em>, he is interested in about what you do. That’s good but I still thought that combining the owners of my chairs and what I’ve done at those places has a significant value. Especially given that most of my professional activity is related to my workplace, and we don’t do a lot of open source code, at least not in my team.</p>

<p>At the same time, I wanted to include some links to my most interesting online appearances, a list of skills grouped by my level of expertise, and my public speaking experience as I’ve started to speak at conferences and plan to keep doing so.</p>

<p>For my previous position, I managed to put in some numbers as achievements, but not yet for my current job. We lack some statistics, I went with using strong verbs for the moment. Anyways, this is what I came up with:</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cv-sandor-dargo-2020-original.png" alt="My Original CV" title="My Original CV" /></p>

<p>I sent it to Yegor as I was interested in his opinion. He told me that he liked the layout, but he would have preferred to read more about what I do, who I am, and less about the places where “I managed to occupy a seat”. Meaning that I should move my jobs to the left part and put my skills and interests to the center.</p>

<p>It felt strange. Okay, to be perfectly honest, it still does. But on the other hand, I realized that I have more technical skills to add, so I could update the previous version too (that’s what I included above). So it was definitely worth doing the exercise.</p>

<p>I came up with the below resume and got better feedback for it, though I still prefer the first one.</p>

<p>What do you think? Which way do you prefer?</p>
