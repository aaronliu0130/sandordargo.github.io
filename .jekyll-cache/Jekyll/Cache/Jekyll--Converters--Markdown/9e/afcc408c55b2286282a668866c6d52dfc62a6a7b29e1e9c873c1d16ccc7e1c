I"ó<p>â€¦ my name is Sandor. I work as a C++ developer, but Iâ€™m also enthusiastic about Python. Before I became a software developer, I was on the dark side. No, I have never been a manager, I meant operations.</p>

<p>I was a DBA in one of the most process-oriented corporations (according to NY Times), but I wanted more freedom and creativity. The more time Iâ€™ve spent on coding, the more I realized how much fun it is and how much I love high-quality code - and how far I am from it!</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not on the road with my family, or not baking something in the kitchen, I read and write. I write mostly about the books I read, the importance of Stoic philosophy, and of course, C++.</p>
