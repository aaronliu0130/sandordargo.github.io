I"@<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2z1aYNu">Never split the difference</a> is a great book on negotiations by a former international hostage negotiator from FBI. <a href="https://twitter.com/VossNegotiation?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Christopher Voss</a> shows us through various stories how and why hostage negotiation strategies changed over time at FBI where he was both a lead and an instructor. While at many points I felt that he was sharing stories with a too vehement pride - maybe itâ€™s more a cultural thing - ha also shared big failures.</p>
