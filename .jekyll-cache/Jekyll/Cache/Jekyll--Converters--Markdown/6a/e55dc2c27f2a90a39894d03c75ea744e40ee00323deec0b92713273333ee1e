I"q<p><em><a href="http://rivieradev.fr/">RivieraDEV</a> is a conference organized by developers and for developers.</em> Thatâ€™s how the organizers advertised the event and you can actually feel it. Especially when you consider that some of the organizers are speakers too. RivieraDEV will be 10 years old next year, for me this was the second one that I attended.</p>
