<p>Let me share a personal story about how reading a book transformed my professional life.</p>

<p>I had a lot of books when I was a toddler and a small kid. I remember that my grandpa was reading a lot to me and most probably my mother as well.</p>

<p>In elementary school, I was a great student. Most of the years I finished with the best grades possible except for PE and music.</p>

<p>You might imagine how much I loved reading, except that it was not true. I loved playing on the computer in a shady room, that‚Äôs what I truly cherished.</p>

<p>I skipped most of the required readings because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be asked about them. I also didn‚Äôt learn the quotes and poems. I was not called out for them. I understood how the game is played and I did the least necessary.</p>

<p>Most probably the problem was that I didn‚Äôt find interesting books and the mandatory reads were not so interesting at the age when we were supposed to read them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when I liked a book, I read it quickly, forgetting completely the world around me. During the 8 years of elementary, there were 3 books like that.</p>

<p>The Eclipse of the Crescent Moon which is a historical novel about the times the Ottoman Empire was conquering my country and my ancestors were fighting against the Turkish occupation in the 16th century.</p>

<p>The second was The Heartless Man‚Äôs Sons which is again a historical novel from the XIXth century Hungary, in particular about the revolution and freedom fight of 1848/49.
I was happy when I had to reread these books in high school, moreover, I reread both on my own as I liked them so much.</p>

<p>The third book was also a biggie, especially for an elementary school 6th grader. I was sent to a text comprehension competition by my headteacher and she gave me the Lord of the Rings. It completely grabbed me into its fantas(t)y(c) world and after the competition, I couldn‚Äôt wait for the other books.</p>

<p>This was the first book that caused me disappointment as a movie. Even though it was an awesome one. But the book is so rich, it engaged my mind, my imagination so much that no film can ever match it.</p>

<p>But apart from these books, I didn‚Äôt read a lot, only car magazines, a bit later PC magazines but those were too expensive for me, and anyways my computer was not performant enough to run the newest, shiniest games.</p>

<p>Yet when I liked something, I couldn‚Äôt put it down. I was an extremely picky binge reader.</p>

<p>Binge reading became a permanent reading during university, I clearly became a book addict.  I don‚Äôt remember which year exactly, but it was quite in the beginning when I picked up the Count of Monte Cristo during the term exams‚Äô period and I read all the books in about 9 days. Hell were I reading a lot!</p>

<p>I always had one book with myself. Some friends were accused of being so snobbish that I wait for them at the pub where they served so cheap red wine with coke, with a book in my hands reading. Nothing like that. I was simply curious. I was simply fascinated by the worlds, the knowledge opened up through those printed pages.</p>

<p>My personal library was growing and I needed more and more space for my books. I started to work, and I kept reading on. It helped me slow down at the end of the day.</p>

<p>Three years into my first corporate job, after I started interviewing for a new position, someone asked me, Sandor, what‚Äôs the latest book that you read on Database Management?</p>

<p>It struck me.</p>

<p>I silently replied that none, I read no professional books. I read the articles. I didn‚Äôt add that those were not articles but mostly answers from StackOverflow‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The manager I was talking to said yes, the same for him. Maybe it was a white lie so that I don‚Äôt feel so bad, maybe it was the truth.</p>

<p>Well, I had on my CV that I love reading and I do, but I didn‚Äôt read any professional books, even though I‚Äôm pretty sure that is some even on MS SQL Server, the technology I had to deal with on a day to day basis.</p>

<p>I was - in fact I‚Äôm still - interested in politics, literature and that‚Äôs what I read. I was amazed by the dedication of my team lead that he read a book on MS SQL Server. I never convinced myself to read that book. It seemed dry and unapplicable. I was so young.</p>

<p>At the age of 28, after a couple of years of working experience, I changed hats and I started my developer journey. Stackoverflow, cplusplus.com they were my best friends. Let‚Äôs be honest, mostly stacko where there was example code that I could copy-paste.</p>

<p>Soon I learnt the syntax and a couple of basic rules and I stopped passing objects by value and I started to mark references as const by default. After a few months, my learning curve slowed down. I felt I was not good, and I didn‚Äôt understand when I should not comment, why on Earth I should extract more functions and God forbid classes when I can do everything at one place.</p>

<p>Yet, my attitude towards reading professional books didn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt start reading books and nobody gave me one. I don‚Äôt say that it would have been someone else‚Äôs responsibility to make me read, but as a mentor, I do recommend books to everyone I‚Äôm mentoring and even to those who I don‚Äôt mentor, I consider it so important.</p>

<p>The transformational moment came about half a year after I joined. My manager left the managerial path and I asked my new boss after a few months how I could get better. Rubens told me that he thinks I‚Äôm on the good track to grow away from being a junior, but I‚Äôd need to learn more, I should read some books.</p>

<p>He recommended me to read <a href="https://amzn.to/36HOaUW">Code Complete</a>.</p>

<p>I started to read it and it was tough. That was my first book on programming and up to that point, I didn‚Äôt read (m)any books in English, only in Hungarian.</p>

<p>I progressed little by little. I read every night. Even during our vacation, I was reading during most of our 5 and a half hours journey on the TGV going to Paris instead of looking at the landscape or discussing with my wife about the coming week.</p>

<p>While I found it difficult to comprehend all the details, a whole new world opened for me. In fact two worlds, one about better code and the other about an endless source of knowledge.</p>

<p>After finishing <a href="https://amzn.to/36HOaUW">Code Complete</a>, I saw my code through completely different glasses - not only because I got new ones thanks to the French healthcare system - and the quality of my code and deliveries started to increase. Let‚Äôs say that the nature of the comments I received in my pull requests drastically changed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/3mKG9UB">second book to read</a> didn‚Äôt come automatically. I still asked for recommendations and I also didn‚Äôt start it right away. But soon, reading technical books became a habit.</p>

<p>A life-changing one.</p>

<p>I started to actively look for books to read building my own reading list and in fact ever since I read almost every day, including technical books that I read on every workday.</p>

<p>Rubens by recommending me <a href="https://amzn.to/36HOaUW">Code Complete</a> clearly changed my life. Maybe he was not the best manager I ever had, but probably the one with the biggest impact on me.</p>

<p>Thank you, Rubens, if you ever read these lines!</p>
