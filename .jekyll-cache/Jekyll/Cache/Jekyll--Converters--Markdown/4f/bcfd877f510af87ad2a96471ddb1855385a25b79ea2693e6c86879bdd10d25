I"î<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2VZrLec">Effective Modern C++</a> is the book with the biggest impact on my professional life recently. As Iâ€™ve written already, I used to work with older versions of C++, mostly with C++03.

<a href="https://www.aristeia.com/">Scott Meyers</a> in <a href="https://amzn.to/2VZrLec">Effective Modern C++</a> explains the new elements of C++11 and goes into details about the tips and tricks about them.</p>

<p>He has 42 (coincidence? I doubtâ€¦) items split into 8 chapters. If you speak a little bit of modern C++, youâ€™ll realize who important those chapters are. Lambdas, Move Semantics, Smart Pointers, the auto keyword. Just to name half of them.</p>

<p>Although this book doesnâ€™t have to be read from cover to cover, I think itâ€™s worth it. But keep it close to you, because itâ€™s the kind of book, youâ€™d be glad to check once in a while. Either for looking up something specific or just to reread some of the item titles and their key takeaways.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2VZrLec">This book</a> is not for those who just started their C++ journey, itâ€™s rather for those who are already familiar with the syntax and worked on at least smaller projects, but either want to make their move to C++11 or just want a better understanding of modern C++.</p>

<p>As usual, <a href="https://www.aristeia.com/">Scott Meyers</a> didnâ€™t disappoint us with his book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2VZrLec">Effective Modern C++</a>, a must-read for C++ programmers.</p>
