I"7<p>Iâ€™ve worked in a couple of different scrum teams, one I even served as a scrum master. There was one common point among all these teams, the scrum master was always or at least used to be a software developer. Then I joined my latest scrum team last summer where our scrum master is a product analyst.</p>
