I"©<p>Why I wanted to read the <a href="http://amzn.to/2xV90jo">book</a>? At work I use mostly 3 languages: C++, Java and Python, depending on my actual project/task. I tend to read a lot of technical books and articles, so I hear often about other languages, other paradigms which are quite unfimilar to me. I have been thinking more and more about learning something completely new (to me) such as functional programming.</p>
