I"q<p>Recently, I’ve built <a href="https://www.dailycppinterview.com/">Daily C++ Interview</a> and since the beginning, I kept something important in mind. I need to provide value, and I don’t need a perfect implementation for that. I don’t need to automate a process if I barely have to perform it, especially if it’s simple and doesn’t take many efforts.</p>
