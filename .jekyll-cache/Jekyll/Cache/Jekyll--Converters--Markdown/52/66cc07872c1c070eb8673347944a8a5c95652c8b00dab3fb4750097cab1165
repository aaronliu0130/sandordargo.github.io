I"œ<p>During the previous weeks, we discussed <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2021/02/10/cpp-concepts-motivations">the motivations behind C++ concepts</a> and <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2021/02/17/cpp-concepts-4-ways-to-use-them">how to use them with functions</a> and <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2021/02/24/cpp-concepts-with-classes">with classes</a>. But we have hardly written any. We defined a functionally incomplete concept called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Number</code> for the sake of example, but thatâ€™s it. Now are going into details on what kind of constraints we can express in a concept.</p>
