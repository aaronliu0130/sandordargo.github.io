<p>At the time I was building a Neo4j database including the wine regions and sub regions in Hungary, just like rhe different types of grapes grown at each. Now I kind of done with this and each week I dedicate a one or two pomodori to gather Hungarian wineries.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/">Uncle Bob</a> writes totally against this in his book <a href="http://amzn.to/2DL4hj7">Clean Architecture</a>. He says that such decisions, like one about the database should be deferred as much as possible. That’s how he built FitNesse for example. I think he is right. But in my case, I was looking for an application to support my learning about Neo4j.</p>

<p>I said that I want this application to be online by the end of September. It’s been up and running since the 29th of October, so I missed my target a month ago. It was already working on my local, but that doesn’t count.</p>

<p>I had some issues with finding free hosting for my application. I had to find a place for the database and for the web app itself. Prefereably at the same place but it didn’t work out. The first place I tried was Python Anywhere. I liked the platform, but the free plan didn’t work out well for me. It doesn’t host databases and although it supports connections to <a href="https://www.graphenedb.com/">graphenedb</a>, but only via http and I wanted to use <a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-3-0-language-drivers/">bolt</a>. In fact I was lazy and didn’t want to modify those few classes.</p>

<p>I ended up using <a href="https://www.heroku.com/home">Heroku</a>, which I think is also fine. In the beginning I found a bit more difficult to deploy my application, but once I learnt how to do it, it’s simple. Now it’s even connected to the hosting github repository, so I have continuous deployment. Though continuous integration is missing, I should think about that.</p>

<p>I host my database at <a href="https://www.graphenedb.com/">grapehedb</a> which has some free plans for small databases and so far so good for me.</p>

<p>I feel that these free services doesn’t provide high availabitity and high speed, but it doesn’t really matter for the moment. I have an application, it’s online and available.</p>

<p>Even though now it provides quite some information, it is quite ugly. So my next steps are to give it a nicer looks and a bit better navigation between the nodes. Even tough I think that the navigation is not that bad since I removed a few bugs and I added navigation though hyperlinks from the details section.</p>
