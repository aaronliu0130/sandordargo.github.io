I"<p>My blog is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. To build it I learnt a lot about HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Jekyll framework itself. Itâ€™s been a great experience. Although, Iâ€™m neither a web designer nor a front-end developer. Itâ€™s not my speciality to build a sexy site from scratch. However, by now I learnt the listed technologies well enough so that I can pick a theme, understand how it works under the hood and customize it to match my needs.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago when I started to build the <a href="http://frugalriviera.com/">Frugal Riviera Blog</a>, I knew that I need something nice and that I donâ€™t have the time or will to build on my own. Looking at my eyes gazed upon <a href="https://github.com/Sylhare/Type-on-Strap">Type on Strap by Sylhare</a>. I liked the design and after some small changes, it started to work as I wanted.</p>

<p>Then first I migrated my <a href="http://mummysherpa.com/">wifeâ€™s blog</a> and the last weekend I finished mine as well. The most difficult part of my migration was to select pictures for the main pages. So it was easy thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Sylhare">Sylhare</a>.</p>

<p>And a big thanks to everyone who reads my blog!</p>
