I"½<p>Once again we were practising <a href="https://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/">Object Calisthenics</a> during our weekly coding dojo. If you donâ€™t know what it is about, Iâ€™d advise you to check out <a href="https://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/">the rules</a>.
