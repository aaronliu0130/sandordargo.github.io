I"ª<p>This topic came up recently during a coding dojo in our department, while we were working on the <a href="https://kata-log.rocks/ugly-trivia-kata">ugly trivia</a> kata. We wanted to extract a struct, containing the player data. Later we wanted to turn it into a real class with logic in it. Only later, as I prefer doing small steps at a time. Hence we started with a pure data container class, a.k.a. a struct in C++.</p>
