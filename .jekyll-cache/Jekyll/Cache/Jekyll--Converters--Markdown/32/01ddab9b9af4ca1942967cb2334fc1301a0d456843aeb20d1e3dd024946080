I"¯<p>I have learned, <a href="http://sandordargo.com/tags/#stl">written</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEmAo6Fdg-Q">spoken</a> a lot about the Standard Template Library during the course of the last years. My sources have been mostly websites such as <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">cppreference.com</a>, <a href="http://cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a>, blogs, youtube videos, but not so many books.</p>
