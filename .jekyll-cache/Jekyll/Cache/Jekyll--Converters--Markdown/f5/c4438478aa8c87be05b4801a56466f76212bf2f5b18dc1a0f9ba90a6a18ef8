I"<p>I have recently read the eye-opening book of <a href="/blog/2018/08/22/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you">Cal Newport, So Good They Canâ€™t Ignore You</a>. He emphasizes a lot on the importance of deliberate practice. I also decided to take a bit more seriously my practice sessions and I reorganized <a href="/blog/2018/02/28/setting-yourself-up-to-succeed">how I spend my personal pomodoros</a> in the morning and at lunchtime to have more deliberate practice. I want to strech my limits. In C++, itâ€™s not so difficult.</p>
