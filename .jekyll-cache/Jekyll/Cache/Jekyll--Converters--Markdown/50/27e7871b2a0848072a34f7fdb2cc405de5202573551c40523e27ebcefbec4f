I"ž<p>You donâ€™t like your job. You get up in the morning, you look into the mirror and you see boredom. No motivation. No excitement. You donâ€™t know why you go to the office again. In fact, you know it well. Someone has to pay for your bills. That someone is you. For how long can you keep doing this? You donâ€™t know, but you put foot after foot, you write line after line and days pass by. Months pass by.</p>
