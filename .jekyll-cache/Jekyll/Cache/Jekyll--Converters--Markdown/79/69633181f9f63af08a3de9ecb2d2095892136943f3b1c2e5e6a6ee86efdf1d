I"U<p>For a couple of weeks I’ve been on <a href="http://tim.blog/category/low-information-diet-and-selective-ignorance/">low information diet</a>. It means that I don’t browse the feed of any social media and I don’t browse general news sites. I had not been watching TV for a long time. Like that I’m much less distracted, but much more focused. The news which are really important still reach me. Either through my wife, through friends, or through the radio I listen to while driving to/from work. I don’t eliminate the radio for the moment, because I find it useful for my French.</p>
