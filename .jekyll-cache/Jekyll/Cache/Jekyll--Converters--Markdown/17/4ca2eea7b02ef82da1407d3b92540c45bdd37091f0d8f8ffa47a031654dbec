I"…<p>Even after spending years in software development, you will find expressions that you simply donâ€™t understand. Even if you are considered somewhat a senior. Those terms might express an advanced concept or something that is more basic, it doesnâ€™t matter. You should always be humble enough to accept that you donâ€™t understand them and hungry enough to seek for comprehension.</p>
