I"i<p>The scrum team I am part of consists of people from several teams, including developers from a handful of different components. Even though Iâ€™m coming from one of these teams, as I had not worked on our component before, and there were totally new components to be implemented in the scope of our project, I have mostly worked on these new components.</p>
