<p><a href="https://leanpub.com/legacycode">The Legacy Code Programmer’s Toolbox</a> is the quite fresh e-book of <a href="https://twitter.com/joboccara">Jonathan Boccara</a>, the person behind <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/">Fluent C++</a>.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly it’s about how to attack legacy code. The author gives practical examples of how we should digest such code and make it better for good. He doesn’t just propose to make any legacy code better, but to decide which parts are worth to change.</p>
