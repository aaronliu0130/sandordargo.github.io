I"ª<p>In the field of software development, you will find more people who like building things from scratch than people who like to work on legacy code. Yet, you will find more developers who will actually work on maintaining code than programmers who build brand new applications. At least thatâ€™s my perception. I work in a big corporation so thatâ€™s kind of expected. Though, it might be different at smaller companies.</p>
