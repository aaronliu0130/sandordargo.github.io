I"Ä<p>Itâ€™s the very end of 2020 and itâ€™s time to review what happened this year, what I achieved, where I failed and what I am going to do next year. I make it public for better accountability and maybe to provide some ideas for others.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="how-covid-changed-my-life">How COVID changed my life?</h2>

<p>If we want to evaluate 2020, even on a personal level, we cannot avoid mentioning COVID.</p>

<p>Maybe itâ€™s a bit strange, one would say even controversial, but <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2020/04/08/gratitude-for-covid19">COVID changed my personal life to the better</a>.</p>

<p>I spend much more time with my children. Even if thatâ€™s something difficult during the workday, I like it. I spend more time with them in the morning, I help them to get ready and we have a common lunch at least on Wednesdays - itâ€™s not a school day in France.</p>

<p>My son goes to a nanny on Tuesdays on Thursdays to socialize before kindergarten and to hear more French. That also means we can have lunch only with my wife twice a week, some time to be alone together, something we didnâ€™t really have for years.</p>

<p>Apart from that? Less travelling, no meetups and fewer conferences.</p>

<p>And of course, the way I work changed completely.</p>

<h2 id="mandatory-home-office">Mandatory Home Office</h2>

<p>I must confess that with a good colleague of mine, we were the last ones to leave the office. We were basically kicked out on 16th March around 10 AM. Since then, I only went back once to get back my stuff.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t want to work from home because originally no screens were provided, I had none at home, I had no comfortable desk nor chair and I was afraid of working with the kids at home.</p>

<p>Finally, I got to work from home with my internal setup of two screens and I invested in a small desk occupying a corner next in our living room and a comfortable chair.</p>

<p>Now I would be the last one to go back to the office and when Iâ€™ll change jobs, most probably Iâ€™ll look for a fully remote position.</p>

<p>I would lie if I said that working from home doesnâ€™t generate tension from time to time. It does, yet itâ€™s still worth it. Both because of the emotional plus and also for the flexibility. Iâ€™m pretty much the person who follows a very strict schedule even in a home office, I donâ€™t like to work at strange hours. But if I have to take care of the kids or some immediate chores, I can and I can make up for it later.</p>

<p>I hope that once the hysterical situation will be getting back to normal, employers - in particular mine - will consider remote work more normal if not as the new norm.</p>

<h2 id="work-work-work">Work, work, work</h2>

<p>This year I spent more time on improving how we prepare for security audits, how we approach software security in general. I managed to dedicate some time to coordinate removing all the C++ compiler warnings from our codebase and now we handle them as errors. With warnings we removed a lot of undefined behaviour, thus making our code more robust.</p>

<p>I improved a lot our tooling, both for security-related activities, for our CI/CD and for ticket management. I have even fewer reasons to leave the command line.</p>

<p>At the end of the year, I started to learn Angular to prepare for a new project. Though itâ€™s unsure yet when Iâ€™ll need it as the project changed even before it started.</p>

<p>My god, I might have to relearn Java a bit. But even I have to, I want to focus on C++ even in the mid-termâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="personal-projects">Personal projects</h2>

<p>C++ has been in my main focus since the beginning of 2018. For almost 3 years. At that point, I made a decision that I must understand it better, much-much better if I donâ€™t want to struggle at my work.</p>

<p>During this journey, I published more than 60 articles about C++, I built some personal projects, and this year I had the opportunity to get into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEmAo6Fdg-Q">C++ On Sea</a> and I spoke along with presenters like Herb Sutter, Kate Gregory or Matt Godbolt.</p>

<p>I also built <a href="https://www.dailycppinterview.com/">Daily C++ Interview</a>, a side project where I send out a C++ interview question every day for free and one can also subscribe for the answer - for a small amount of money.</p>

<p>I built <a href="https://github.com/sandordargo/cmake-project-creator">CMake Project Creator</a> to significantly limit the time you need to set upÂ a new C++ project. Contributors are welcome!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been publishing book reviews for almost 4 years, and this year I decided to improve their depth and add more quality to it. In parallel, <a href="https://devreads.sandordargo.com/">I created a subdomain on my personal page</a> where I publish only book reviews and I created a dedicated newsletter.</p>

<p>Right now, <a href="https://dev.to/sandordargo/series/10085">Iâ€™m working on the DigitalOcean Hackathon</a>. Iâ€™m creating something an <a href="https://dev-analytics-frontend-tudwb.ondigitalocean.app/">online platofrm</a> for <a href="https://github.com/sandordargo/dev-to-analytics">DevAnalytics</a> where DEV authors can get some insights about how their articles, tags perform.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t like to work on multiple side projects at the same time, but this hackathon hit me as a surprise, while I already started to work on something for my wife. A Flutter app that helps to track how many clothes our kids have. So if she sees something, like a good deal, she can quickly check if we need anything from that size, form that kind of clothes. Itâ€™s already in a good shape, Iâ€™ll publish it in a month or two.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-waiting-for-me-in-2021">What is waiting for me in 2021?</h2>

<p>I hope we can go this year to the Azoresâ€¦ A 3-week tripÂ we were waiting for a long time, and we had to cancel it for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>I already started, but most of it will come next year. Iâ€™m helping as a proofreader <a href="https://twitter.com/rainer_grimm">Rainer Grimmâ€™s</a> work on <a href="https://leanpub.com/c20">his new book, C++20</a>. Itâ€™s very rewarding. I get some insights on how to edit a book, my name will be mentioned in the acknowledgements section and I can learn C++20 quite in the beginning. I donâ€™t have to mention, Iâ€™m reading it very thoroughly.</p>

<p>Speaking about books, in 2021 I plan to finish my first book, The Seniority Trap. You could already read <a href="https://dev.to/sandordargo/series/9489">some excerpts</a> from the first few chapters.</p>

<p>I continue to improve my C++ skills, I still have to make a plan for how to doÂ it. But I think, concepts now provide plenty of opportunities, and templates were an area where I definitely need some improvement.</p>

<p>I also plan to transform <a href="https://www.dailycppinterview.com/">Daily C++ Interview</a>, as in its current form itâ€™s not sustainable. I cannot keep adding new questions until the end of the world - though it might be closer than Iâ€™d think. I dedicated myself to add questions throughout 2020Q4 and I donâ€™t quit before it ends. But I already started to think about how to transform this product. Most probably, Iâ€™m going to revamp it into a 128 days program that requires less daily attention and I can focus more on the other projects I have.</p>

<p>At work, I will have to be a better thought leader, I have to speak more and be more active at meetings. I have to act as a leader, even as in individual contributor if I want to progress into more senior roles, like a staff or a principal engineer. Itâ€™s not enough to find and fix problems, I have to shape more the discussions we have.</p>

<p>I have to continue working on my routines and incorporate more about my body. I already made some progress, but Iâ€™m far from the end.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thatâ€™s a bit long, but a lot of things happened, I worked on a lot of things. And despite COVID, 2020 was a great year and Iâ€™m pretty sure that 2021 will be even better.</p>

<p>I wish you a happy new year!</p>
