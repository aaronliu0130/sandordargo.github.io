I"Û<p>Yes. These months I work a bit far from my manager on a separate project with people from many different teams.</p>

<p>He scheduled a meeting with me which I thought would be about my middle year review. I hadnled the meeting and the preparation to it as such.</p>

<p>I thought it is about that even during the first quite a few minutes of the meeting. I thought it was just not called that because now it is a bit more difficult to evaluate my performance as I am working farther from my originating team.</p>

<p>It turned out later that this is not about a middle year review, my manager was just curious what I have done during the last two months and he wants to see if I have any problem which he can help with. The first part is natural, the second part is a praiseworthy attitude.</p>

<p>We agreed that luckily I donâ€™t need his help. There are no big issues within our team. The problem of effective time management and the waste of othersâ€™ time can be sorted out during continuous improvement supported by our retrospective meetings.</p>

<p><em>PS: I still think that this meeting took place because managers think they need face to faces and we could have had the same effect with video call if I worked remotely</em></p>
