I"N<p>This is post is not yet another one about Git aliases. Some like them, some don’t. I use only a few. For the commands, I use the most and the ones I wouldn’t forget anyway. In other words, I’m lazy to write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit</code> all the time. These aliases are not worth a post. On the other hand, I modify my prompt in the terminal to give me a lot of information about the current state of the repository I’m at and I also use auto-completion for git commands.</p>
