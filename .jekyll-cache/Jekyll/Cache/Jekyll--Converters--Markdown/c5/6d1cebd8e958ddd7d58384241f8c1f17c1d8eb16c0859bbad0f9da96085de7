I"≠<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2sabi9v">Code Ahead</a>, what shall I call you? You are a novel. A fiction. Yet according to you, you‚Äôre semi-autobiographical. You are a rather exact picture of how things go in software development. Yet you‚Äôre also a manifesto of how things should go instead. You give lots of pieces of advice on ‚Äúprogramming, debugging, releasing, testing, organizing, teamwork and management issues‚Äù.</p>
