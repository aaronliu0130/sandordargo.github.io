I"<p>After <a href="https://www.dailycppinterview.com/">Daily C++ Interview</a> that I introduced in early September, let me share with you another project I have been working on for in my learning time for the last couple of months. <a href="https://github.com/sandordargo/cmake-project-creator">Cmake Project Creator</a> is fully open source, and if you are looking forward to <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>, this might be interesting for you in case you speak Python and interested in C++.</p>
