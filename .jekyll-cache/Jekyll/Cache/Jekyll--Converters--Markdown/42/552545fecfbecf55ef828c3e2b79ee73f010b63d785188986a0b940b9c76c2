<p>That other night I was struggling. I felt an urge to write some code. I hadn’t written any during the day. Barely during the week. Am I a developer or what? How can it be that I don’t even write code every day? Well, at least I read some while investigating a problem. Of course, the code was not of good quality, it was pure legacy with all of its connoted meaning. At least it was some code. Some decent procedural code disguised in an enormous function of a god-like object.</p>
