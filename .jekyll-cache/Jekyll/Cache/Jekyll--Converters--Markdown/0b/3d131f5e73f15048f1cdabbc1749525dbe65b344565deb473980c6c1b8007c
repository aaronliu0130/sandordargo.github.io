I"d<p>You might have read my <a href="/blog/2018/02/28/setting-yourself-up-to-succeed">post about how I organize my activities</a> and I mentioned a kind of a kanban board I use, that I took from <a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/">Sonmez</a>. His <a href="http://amzn.to/2HE30fK">Career Guide</a> is organized into 60 chapters on almost 800 pages so that he could easily broke his tasks down into daily pomodori fitting his kanban board.</p>

<p>So the book is like a huge collection of blog posts - and in fact it is -, but that’s an advantage of it. Luckily the chapters are quite well organized and the book offers you a nice reading experience both by reading cover to cover or by jusdt picking a few chapters.</p>

<p>Obvisouly I don’t want to summarize the 80 chapters here. But if you’d like to know more about the different types of employments, if you want to have another - relevant - opinion on how to advance your career, how to search for a job, how to negotiate, read <a href="http://amzn.to/2HE30fK">this book</a> or read a few articles at <a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/">Simple Programmer</a>.</p>

<p>What I like the most about <a href="http://amzn.to/2HE30fK">this book</a> is that the author doesn’t just bullshit around. Sonmez writes about sensitive topics and he shares his own opinions even when they are out of the mainstream. Kudos!</p>
