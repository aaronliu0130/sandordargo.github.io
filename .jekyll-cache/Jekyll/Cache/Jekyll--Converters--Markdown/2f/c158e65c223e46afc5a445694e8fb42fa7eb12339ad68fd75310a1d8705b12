I"í<p>After I attended a training on the subject of optimizing C++, I felt Iâ€™d be interested in going a bit deeper. At least to read a bit more about this topic. So I asked the trainer for some books heâ€™d recommend about optimization. One was <a href="https://amzn.to/2vGyHRT">Kurt Guntherothâ€™s Optimized C++</a>. As soon as I finished reading <a href="/blog/2018/06/27/essential-skills-for-the-agile-developer">Essential Skills for the Agile Developer</a>, I started to read this one.</p>
