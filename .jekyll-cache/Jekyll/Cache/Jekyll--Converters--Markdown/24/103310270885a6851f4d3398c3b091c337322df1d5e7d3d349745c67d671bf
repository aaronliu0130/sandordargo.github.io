I"¢<p>My IntelliJ stopped working properly. When I clicked on run tests, it only compiled the code but never ran anything. I spent some time investigating the issue, I tried to fix this erroneous state, but nothing helped. Reboot (haha), reindexing, other JDK, new run configuration, removing all the settings. Nothing. No clue on stackoverflow either.</p>

<p>It was time to upgrade my Intellij anywayâ€¦</p>

<p>When I installed the new version on my Ubuntu machine, the compilation of my first Java project failed. Wow. The continuous integration is running fine and I changed nothing in localâ€¦ So letâ€™s see. Cannot find javafx.util.Pair. Hm. Uhum.. No problem. The magical alt+enter didnâ€™t work. I checked the jars, the corresponding one was not added to the project.</p>

<p>While looking for the jar, I realized how strange it is that I cannot use a simple Pair class easily. Probably I should use another Pair. There must be something in java.util!</p>

<p>And yet nothing. Then I started to dig and I found on stackoverflow that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/156275/what-is-the-equivalent-of-the-c-pairl-r-in-java">there is no pair in Java</a>. Instead of fuzzy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">second</code> references, I should write an own class for those two values I want to hold. It makes sense.</p>

<p>Fair enough, I wrote a new data container and removed all the references to javafx.util.Pair. My code compiled and my tests ran.</p>

<p>Bottomline is that if you are learning a new language, donâ€™t take anything granted. Not even a Pair. And doublecheck what you import.</p>
