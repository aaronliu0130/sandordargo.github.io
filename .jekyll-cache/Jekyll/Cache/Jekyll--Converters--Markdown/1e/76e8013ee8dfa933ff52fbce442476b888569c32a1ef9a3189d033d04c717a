<p>Long story short, do work remotely, either in your current job or start an online business. Eliminate and/or outsource every task you can, focus on the 20% which brings 80% of your results and live like a rock star. Preferably in cheaper cities/countries than your actual one.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m happy with my current job, but obviously I have goals. Bigger goals. But I have understood recently - not only because of <a href="http://amzn.to/2xr4h7z">this book</a> - that I need clearer goals. Clearer and bigger goals. And habits of course - different story.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s up to me to define them soon. Sooner then that! Possibly 20 years ago, if not, now!</p>

<p>But I also want to think about a muse. A muse is an automated online business which finances my dreamlines. Oh, I need dreamlines too.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s get to work on those.</p>
