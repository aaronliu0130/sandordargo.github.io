I"8<p>I’ve already written quite a few articles about features introduced by C++ 11 and how much it changed how I look at the language. The feature I liked the most is probably the one of lambda expressions. I don’t like them for their sheer existence, it’s not <em>l’art pour l’art</em>, but it really helps using the different STL algorithms. If you want to get a quick introduction to all the 105, have a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2olsGf6JIkU">this video</a> by the owner of <a href="https://www.fluentcpp.com/">fluentcpp.com</a>.</p>
