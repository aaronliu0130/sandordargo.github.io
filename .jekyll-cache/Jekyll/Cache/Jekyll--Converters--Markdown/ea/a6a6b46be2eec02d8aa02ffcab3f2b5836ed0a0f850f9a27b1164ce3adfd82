I"&<p>My blog is powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. To build it I learnt a lot about HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Jekyll framework itself. It’s been a great experience. Although, I’m neither a web designer nor a front-end developer. It’s not my speciality to build a sexy site from scratch. However, by now I learnt the listed technologies well enough so that I can pick a theme, understand how it works under the hood and customize it to match my needs.</p>
