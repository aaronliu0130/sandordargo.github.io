I"#<p>I’m not good at connecting people. I’m too introverted and maybe still a bit shy. I was like that as a child and I’m still a bit. Even though the years I spent at working in and next to politics helped me a lot to overcome this weakness.</p>

<p>The book is organized around four parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fundamental techniques in handling people</li>
  <li>Six ways to make people like you</li>
  <li>How to win people to your way of thinking</li>
  <li>Be a leader: How to change people without giving offence or arousing resentment</li>
</ul>

<p>In these parts, he gives practical pieces of advice how to accomplish each goal. As this is a book, not just a small article organised of a few lists, he goes into details and gives examples of how to use his instructions.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I already implemented all of them, but I try to incorporate the suggestions one by one. For example, I try to criticise and complain less, that’s something that most of the Hungarian and French people should follow I think. Besides, I also try to give honest appreciation more frequently. Telling someone how good he or she is, is not a sign of weakness.</p>

<p>I also smile and try to ask questions whose answers really interest me. It helps to become a better listener.</p>

<p>Do I already see some results? Hell, I do! The first day I started to use the advice of giving sincere appreciation I gained one new friend at work.</p>

<p>I think if I manage to keep Carnegie Dale’s suggestions in my focus and change the way I interact with people it will help me achieve an even bigger success than I dreamed about. And you can do the same. I’d definitely advise you to grab <a href="https://amzn.to/2JJfhBc">this book</a> as your next read and start to follow the rules written inside, one by one. Good luck!</p>
