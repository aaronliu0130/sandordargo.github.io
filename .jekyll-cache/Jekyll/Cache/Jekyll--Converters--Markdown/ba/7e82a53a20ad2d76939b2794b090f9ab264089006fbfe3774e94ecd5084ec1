I"€<p>I read an article about <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/why-99-percent-of-all-meetings-are-a-complete-wast.html">meetings as complete time and money wasters</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/jeff_haden">Jeff Hadenâ€™s</a> opinion is that 99% of the meetings are a waste of money for the company. The author seems to be very strict, but all in all he seems to be right.</p>
