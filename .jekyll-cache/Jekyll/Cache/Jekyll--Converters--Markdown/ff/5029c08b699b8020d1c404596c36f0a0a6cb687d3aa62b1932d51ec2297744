I"û<p>The first thing that is important to clarify about this book is that itâ€™s not about self-development. Itâ€™s not about how to become better as an individual. Itâ€™s about companies. <a href="https://amzn.to/3q1nJBh">This book</a> is the summary of a long research on why some companies who used to be average make the leap to become great. I wonâ€™t go into details on the definition of great, but the bottom line that great companies outperform the market for a long time and with different CEOs.</p>
