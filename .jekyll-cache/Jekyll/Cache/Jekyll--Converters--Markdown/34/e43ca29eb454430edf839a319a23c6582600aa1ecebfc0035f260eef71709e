I"É<p>Then when my daughter arrived to our world, I spent a month at home. Even though being with a new born is a tough job, I could dedicate a little bit of time to learn, to stretch my mind every day. First I started to import and visualize geographical data such as countries, cities, airports and related properties. It was interesting, but I didnâ€™t follow up on it as I did not see itâ€™s imminent value in a world of Google Maps and OpenStreetMap.</p>
