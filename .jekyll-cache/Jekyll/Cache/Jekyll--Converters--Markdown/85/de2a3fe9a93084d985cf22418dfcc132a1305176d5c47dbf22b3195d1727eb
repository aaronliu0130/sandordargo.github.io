I"<p>I’ve got something to share. Something I’ve been building for the last few weeks has gone live today: <a href="https://www.dailycppinterview.com/">Daily Cpp Interview</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="what-is-daily-cpp-interview-about">What is Daily Cpp Interview about?</h2>

<p>It’s extremely simple. You subscribe and you’ll receive a question or an exercise every day strongly related to C++. These questions will help you keep your skills sharp, keep your knowledge up to date, and not fading away.</p>

<p>You’ll either get a more theoretical question about C++ such as what vtables are for, or you will get a piece of code that you will have to reason about, what it does exactly and why, or there is a third option: you have to write a short piece of code.</p>

<h2 id="but-how-do-i-know-if-my-answer-is-right">But how do I know if my answer is right?</h2>

<p>That’s an important question to ask! The questions themselves help you inspiring your learning process, help you grow, or actually keep your knowledge from vanishing - repetition is the mother of all learning. With Daily Cpp Interview, you prepare for your C++ interviews.</p>

<p>So do you get the answers?</p>

<p>You’ll find a link in each daily mail to a page where you can subscribe to the Pro edition. If you are a Pro subscriber, with each question you’ll receive the solution as well. After your subscription is confirmed, you’ll receive the previous answers as well.</p>

<p>I think the price is fairly reasonable, a little bit less than 10 Euros a month, and if you subscribe for the whole year, you get two months for free.</p>

<h2 id="come-on-i-dont-care-about-c-but-how-did-you-build-it">Come on, I don’t care about C++, but how did you build it?</h2>

<p>I’m sure that are many of you interested in this part.</p>

<p>While I won’t go into the very details of the code and some parts are still evolving, I’d love to share the major parts.</p>

<p>The site itself is not very interesting, a simple static Github page built with Jekyll.</p>

<p>What is more interesting is what is behind.</p>

<p>For the time being, I try to use as many free or cheap services as possible.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.sendinblue.com/">Sendinblue</a> to build the subscription forms and to have a mailing list, but I send the daily emails with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/">AWS SES</a> which is simply cheaper.</p>

<p>With Sendinblue’s free tier I can store as many addresses as I can and AWS SES’s free tier should be enough for my needs. If not, even better.</p>

<p>On AWS side, I also use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Dynamo DB</a> to keep track of my users and I also store the questions and answers there. Again, the free tier should suffice.</p>

<p>The data transfer between Sendinblue and AWS services is managed with <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. Just like the data sharing between Stripe and AWS. So yes, I take payments with <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> client only integration.</p>

<p>Possibly my free Zapier resources will run out, but it will be a good sign and I’ll be happy to pay.</p>

<p>As you can see, it’s fairly simple. For the “backend part” I mostly use free or cheap services and python code, the ultimate glue language.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I built <a href="https://www.dailycppinterview.com/">DailyCppInterview</a> in about a month during my mornings and evenings with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>There are still things to better on the page, in the integrations, but I think that the most important thing is to go out and deliver. Deliver iteratively, otherwise, I’d just stuck in a “still not good enough” state and would never publish.</p>

<p>I’m sure that some people will find it helpful and some will maybe even subscribe which will be great. If not, I already learned a lot about AWS, different tools, and integrations that was already worth it.</p>

<p>If you are a C++ developer, please go ahead and <a href="https://www.dailycppinterview.com/">subscribe for the free daily newsletter</a>.</p>
