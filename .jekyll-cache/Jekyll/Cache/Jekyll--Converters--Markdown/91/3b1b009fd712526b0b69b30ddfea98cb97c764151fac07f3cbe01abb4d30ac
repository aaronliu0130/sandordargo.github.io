I"â<p>I read once again a very interesting book by <a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2018/10/31/nassim-taleb-the-black-swan">Nassim Taleb</a>. I realized that I donâ€™t just like his books, but I sympathize with the author, with his style, with his sarcasm. More than that, I like that someone without social sciences background writes about philosophy, about life. He is a former options trader and risk analyst, a statistician with quite some experience in real life. I think about him as I think about stoics, about Ryan Holiday. For these people, philosophy is not something they think about in their ivory towers far away from people. No, for them, philosophy is a way to conduct their lives. To me, they are more credible.</p>
