I"f<p>I used to use another host to have a blog. As it tends to be down more than up, I was really happy when I read about <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHubPages</a>. Thank you <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/">Yegor</a>!
So I will lead a new blog here about what I do, what I learn, etc.
Letâ€™s rock!</p>
