I"w<p>I joined <a href="https://dev.to/sandordargo">DEV.to</a> a bit more than two years ago. I donâ€™t remember at all how I found this website, but it seemed welcoming. I particularly liked its really simple design. As a backend guy, it was very compelling to me. It seemed easy to join and publish my small number of articles to come, so I said why not giving it a try?!</p>
