I"ÿ<p>I was looking for some books for these months taking into consideration that I should improve my architecture and design skills. So <a href="https://devreads.sandordargo.com/emergent-design/">I recently read Emergent Design</a> and now <a href="https://amzn.to/36rDKbh">Refactoring for Software Design Smells</a>. I donâ€™t remember where I saw it recommended, but when I started to browse the book (I use Oâ€™Reilly), I saw it was recommended by the ACM fellow, Grady Booch. The person who authored <a href="https://amzn.to/2MBmvNU">Object-Oriented Analysis and Design With Applications</a> and who said that code should read like well-written prose. It seemed to be a good recommendation.</p>

<p>Was it worth to read the book? Letâ€™s find it out together.</p>
