I":<p>When I decided to read <a href="https://amzn.to/37IpgFb">Awken the Giant Within</a>, I was a bit surprised. I thought it’s much newer, but in fact, it’s from the very beginning of the 1990s. It doesn’t make it less relevant and this book is still very popular. Kind of a good sign.</p>

<p>I find the author, Tony Robbins, an authentic person to write such a book. He left home at the age of 17, he also left college and started to work as a janitor. Then he made up his mind and became one of the most important coaches, motivational speakers of our age.</p>
