I"å<p>Why is it that #CleanCode is still the exception and not the norm in so many companies?</p>

<p>A very interesting question from <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcusBiel">Marcus Biel</a>, who was the Director of Developer Experience at RedHat at that time posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6481563683385278464">LinkedIn</a>. That moment, I didnâ€™t have the time to go deep on this topic, but I reread the answers a couple of months later.</p>
