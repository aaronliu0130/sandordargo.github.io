I"<p>I’ve been running my personal blog since the end of 2016 and starting from mid-2017, I’ve been posting at least one article almost every week. My blog has not and does not have one single topic, I mostly write about C++, sometimes about career development, management or how Stoicism can be applied to our craft and I write about books.</p>

<p>I write a lot about books.</p>
