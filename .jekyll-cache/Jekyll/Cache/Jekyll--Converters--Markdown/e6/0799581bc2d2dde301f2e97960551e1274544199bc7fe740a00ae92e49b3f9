I"—<p>If you follow me, you might already have noticed that <a href="/blog/2018/03/28/codereview-guidelines">Iâ€™m a big fan of coding guidelines</a>. Yet, I donâ€™t particularly enjoy commenting on formatting, such as indentation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI">tabs vs spaces</a>, whitespacing, etcâ€¦ But I do and I keep doing it because itâ€™s an important part of readability.</p>
