I"W<p>I’m still not looking for a new job, and - given the circumstances - luckily I don’t even have to. Still, after having met some people and having received a couple of interesting propositions I realized that I didn’t even have a CV. The latest version I had was 7 years old, something that I used for getting my actual job. Since then I’ve been eagerly updating my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandor-dargo/">Linkedin profile</a> to document what I’ve done, but even though I enjoy reading articles about how to craft high-quality resumés I never actually refreshed my CV.</p>
