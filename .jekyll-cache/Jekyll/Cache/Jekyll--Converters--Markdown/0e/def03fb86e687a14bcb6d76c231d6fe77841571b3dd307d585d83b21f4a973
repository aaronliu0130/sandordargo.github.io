I"+<p>I am going to work on a so called product#on. In my company’s terms it means a usually 3, or in this case a 6 months assignment where the participants work in startup mode.</p>

<p>Okay. Maybe not in startup mode - I never worked in a startup. But the goal is to get isolated from your original team and temporarily work on a new product. Normally on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). I don’t want to write down the details of the project but it involves data processing, big data, functional programming and the cloud.</p>

<p>It’s definitely something I was hoping for, I was looking for.</p>

<p>A few months ago I already went to a presentation of another product#on, but I was not engaged. I didn’t feel so excited about it, although the idea was interesting. This time, it was different. I knew immediately I wanted to join. The idea, the listed technologies, both seemed a great opportunity which I had to seize.</p>

<p>Of course it’s not so simple, you cannot just apply you need the support of your management.</p>

<p>To get the final approval from them was not fast but they were really helpful. I was in contact with my unit manager (level+1), he shared with me the concerns, burocretic problems they were facing, he didn’t just bullshit around. My senior manager (level+2) helped me a lot, even her manager.</p>

<p>They made it possible that I can join the project not only for three but for six months which more than I have hoped for, more than I have imagined. I am grateful for them and for myself. I asked for help and they did not treat me as a traitor who just wants to leave the team.</p>

<p>They gave me a hand.</p>

<p>I experienced once again that it’s worth to ask. Even you don’t get what you want right away, still you might get it.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid, be bold and ask for it.</p>
