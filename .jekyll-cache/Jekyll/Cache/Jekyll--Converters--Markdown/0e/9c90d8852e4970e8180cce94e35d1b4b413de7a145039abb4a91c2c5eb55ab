I"˜<p>Given that I really enjoyed Cal Newportâ€™s ideas in <a href="/blog/2018/08/22/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you">So Good They Canâ€™t Ignore You</a> and also the way he writes, I decided to read his other best-seller book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2MgHsN6">Deep Work</a>, right after. The idea of deep work was far from new to me, but I was interested in the book and the interpretation of it by Newport.</p>
