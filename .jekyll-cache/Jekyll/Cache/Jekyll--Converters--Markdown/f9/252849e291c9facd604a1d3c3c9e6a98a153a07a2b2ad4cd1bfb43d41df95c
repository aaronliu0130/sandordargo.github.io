<p>Have you ever felt discouraged after a difficult problem you solved? Have you ever felt that your profession is maybe not for you? And then, the next time when you fixed a nasty bug maybe you felt superhuman. You might have even thought that you’re the most badass rock start developer in your whole company. Didn’t you? Well, maybe you just felt that you’ve reached new heights of seniority which by the way shouldn’t be used as an observation deck from where you can look down to the other junior fellas.</p>
