I"Ê<p>You might have noticed that I donâ€™t just read technical books. In fact, at least half of the books I read are non-technical. A couple of months ago, I found a great deal on Amazon and I could get Ryan Holidaysâ€™ <a href="https://amzn.to/2vbk9d0">Perennial Seller</a> for less than 3 bucks in the e-book version. Will it be a perennial seller? That I canâ€™t tell, but itâ€™s definitely an interesting book for those who are interested in creation.</p>
