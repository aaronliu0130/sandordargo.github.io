I"<p>Sandor, are you posting a book about web development? What are you having in mind? Are you changing from C++ to something else?</p>

<p>No. Not at all. While it’s true that I’ve built some sites, such as <a href="https://www.dailycppinterview.com/">Daily C++ Interview</a>, I simply think that all developers should be familiar with some basic concepts of usability. I thought that I’ll get some concepts that can easily be interpreted in other areas as well. Plus I liked the title. Let’s see if it was worth the time!</p>
