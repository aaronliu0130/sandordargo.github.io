<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2IPVUZh">Driving Technical Change</a> is a book for the rest. For those who like to stand up and take the lead, for those who have ideas, for those who donâ€™t believe that something should be done in a way just because itâ€™s been like that.</p>

<p>If you are such a person, you know that itâ€™s not enough to have ideas. You will face apathy at best, but more probably resistance. You need perseverance, but itâ€™s not enough. It makes no good repeating the old bad patterns and alienating friends and colleagues. You need understanding, techniques, strategies. Then you can go out and practice to change your world, that is - just remember! - othersâ€™ world too. Thatâ€™s the point.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2IPVUZh">Driving Technical Change</a> helps you learn how to take the initiative.</p>

<p>First, it describes the different kinds of resistance youâ€™ll face. Youâ€™ll learn that most people are <em>Time Crunched</em>, already too busy, sometimes too busy for improvements. Itâ€™s not impossible to turn them around!</p>

<p>The <em>Uninformed</em> and the <em>Herd</em> are relatively easy to deal with. They need information and leadership. And you are there to provide them with all of that. But beware, sharing information and being a leader come with great responsibility!</p>

<p>The <em>Burned</em> and the <em>Cynic</em> are more difficult to work with, but yet the book will provide some stories and strategies to help you deal with them.</p>

<p>The <em>Boss</em> is the boss. You should communicate with her in her language, not yours, and your chances are good. If your cause makes sense, of course. In her language.</p>

<p>However, even this book doesnâ€™t offer a lot with regards to the <em>Irrational</em>. They are simply irrational. The best thing is to avoid them as long as possible.</p>

<p>Once you understood who youâ€™ll have to deal with, youâ€™ll be handed 9 different techniques to work with them. But whatever you do, the most important message is that solving a problem and pushing for a solution are two different things. You have to make sure that the problem you see does really exist and you have to be flexible. Your solution might not be the only one and it might not be the best.</p>

<p>Whatever techniques youâ€™ll choose to work with, you have to keep in mind the way that you should follow in almost all cases.</p>

<p>You are not a lone wolf. Youâ€™ll need associates.</p>

<p>As I already mentioned, first you will have to <strong>ignore</strong> everyone who is <strong>hostile</strong>. Hostility just reproduces itself and thatâ€™s the last thing, youâ€™d need.</p>

<p>You will have to <strong>target</strong> first <strong>the willing</strong> who are likely to adopt the changes you push for.</p>

<p>Then you have to <strong>harness the converted</strong>, meaning that they should not only accept the solution you propose, but they should also support you in your quest to make it accepted by the organization. With them, you will not be alone!</p>

<p>And once the size of the supportersâ€™ group is growing, you should finally <strong>convince the management</strong> to accept your proposal.</p>

<p>Is it that simple? Yes. Is it easy? No, as even the author admits. But <a href="https://amzn.to/2IPVUZh">Driving Technical Change</a> gives you a hand to make it easier.</p>

<p>Happy reading!</p>
