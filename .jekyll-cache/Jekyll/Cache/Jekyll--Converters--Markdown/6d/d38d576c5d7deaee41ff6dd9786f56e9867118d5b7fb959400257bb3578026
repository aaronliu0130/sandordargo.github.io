I"ê<p>It‚Äôs an awfully mainstream question nowadays that who should a company keep or whom it should let go. The question stands firm from the other side as well. What is a fair selection? Why me? Or if you are luckier, why him and not the other one? What shall I do - differently - in the future to stay on the top of the pack? What attitude will keep me safe in times of adversity and recession?</p>
