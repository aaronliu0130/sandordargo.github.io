I"r<p>How many times have you thought, oh I will find a way to get out of the way of this problem? Just this time I promise! And then you gently stepped aside. Later you were looking with eyes open wide they asked if you knew about. Or even worse, when someone presented how she solved that issue you thought you could have done it too. You even felt some envy, right?</p>
