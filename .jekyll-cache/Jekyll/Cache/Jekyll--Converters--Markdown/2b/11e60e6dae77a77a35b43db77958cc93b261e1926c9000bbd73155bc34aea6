I"‚<p>If you have spent some time reading modern self-improvement books, itâ€™s almost for sure that you came across the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_Ziglar">Zig Ziglar</a> and his book called <a href="https://amzn.to/3fozoUp">See You At The Top</a>.</p>

<p>Ziglar after dropping out of college started to work as a salesman of some cookware company in the US. According to his book, later even one of his brothers followed him to his career. And Ziglar had some decent successes as a cookware salesman, but we donâ€™t remember him because he helped thousands of American families to eat dinner cooked in some nice pans.</p>
