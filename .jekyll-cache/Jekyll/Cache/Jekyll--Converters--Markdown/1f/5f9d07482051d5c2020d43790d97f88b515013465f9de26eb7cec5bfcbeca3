I"™<p>In the middle of February, one of my colleagues, Bob told me on chat that he hadnâ€™t had yet his yearly performance review. It was due by the end of January. He was rather surprised, that I actually completed it. That is because Iâ€™m really pushy on my one-2-ones and reviews. I made sure that my manager scheduled it before I left on long vacations. When it had to be rescheduled I took care of it.</p>
