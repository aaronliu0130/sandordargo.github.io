I"þ<p>In fact we want to upload our code to a local OpenShift instance with the help of Fabric8 plugin. Maybe there is an IntelliJ plugin, but I did not go into that direction.</p>

<p>The first time I ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mvn install</code>, everything went fine. Compilation succesful, packaging as well, I could deploy my server on Openshift in a minute. Great. There I had some problems though, my server didnâ€™t start up.</p>

<p>I changed some settings in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pom.xml</code> to remove some unsupported dependencies and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mvn</code> again. Nothing. I mean nothing but failure. It couldnâ€™t fine some dependencies. I did not change anything regarding those and it used to workâ€¦</p>

<p>Hmâ€¦ I was checking my maven home, checking if the packages are available in our company repository, but I found no clues. Everything seemed fine. Another guy who says he has some experience with maven checked my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pom.xml</code>, but couldnâ€™t find anything.</p>

<p>I tried to generate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pom.xml</code> by maven, but surprisingly it didnâ€™t fix anything.</p>

<p>Long story short, I found that my dependencies were only declared in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;</code> section which is useful if you have child projects which inherit dependencies and their versions. But it is for version control, you still have to declare your dependencies in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pom.xml</code>, otherwise itâ€™s not going to work. I only had the dependencies listed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;</code> section. After I listed them only in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;dependencies&gt;</code>, it started to work.</p>

<p>Good that I learnt something.</p>
