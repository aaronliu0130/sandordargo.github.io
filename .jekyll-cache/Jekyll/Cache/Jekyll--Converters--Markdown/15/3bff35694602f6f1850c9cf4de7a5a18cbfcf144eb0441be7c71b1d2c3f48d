I"<p>So I had to explore what technology I could use for visualizing my data. When I was building my <a href="https://github.com/sandordargo/family-tree">family tree</a> application I used <a href="http://sigmajs.org/">sigma.js</a> but looking back at it, I didnâ€™t find it very intuitive. Maybe because of my poor JS skills. Anyway, I decided to look around what is available to use. I started my exploration from <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-data-visualization/">Neo4jâ€™s data visualization guide</a>.</p>

<p>My first choice was <a href="http://graphalchemist.github.io/Alchemy/#/">Alchemy.js</a>. At a first glance the code examples seemed quite easy to understand and I liked that there is some documentation. And in the end if it is listed on Neo4jâ€™s site, can it be that bad? Well. For me it did not work out. I faced the first problems when I wanted to include in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> files the library with a URL. The URL was broken. Okayâ€¦ So I downloaded the library and copied the source code into my project. Not a big deal.</p>

<p>After some research it turned out that I had to include something else. If I remember well, it was <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>, nothing more. But Iâ€™m not if it was the only library.</p>

<p>Finally I managed to plot a nice graph with some nodes representing Hungarian wine regions and sub-regions. It was nice.</p>

<p>The next set of problems found me when I wanted to add some interactivity to the graph. Long story short, the project seems a bit abandoned and the documentation is outdated. The code doesnâ€™t do what the docs say and even the API changed. I kept quite some time hacking the source code in javascript - do you remember that I donâ€™t know javascript? - and finally I concluded that this is just not going to work out.</p>

<p>However at the dependencies I met with <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> which was also mentioned in the <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-data-visualization/">guide</a> and at some other places. It was also mentioned that itâ€™d be quite difficult to use for a newbie as me as you have to take care of a lot of configurations manually.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s said that taking the upper road is always beneficial. So I took it. Within less time and with less frustration I reached the same point as with Alchemy before. But it was mostly copy-pasting some parts from here and there and welding them together. Still - or more hence - there are some parts which are not working well. Such as gravity and scaling. Maybe they are not that important at the first iteration. But stillâ€¦</p>

<p>So I decided to learn <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js v4</a> better. However I donâ€™t want to spend weeks on reading books and learning javascript from scrach. The same time, I have been reading John Sonmezâ€™s book called <a href="http://amzn.to/2wK0lLI">Soft Skills:The software developerâ€™s life manual</a>. In it he lists some learning techniques which helped him to produce a lot of educational material quite fast. I decided to give a try to his techniques. Iâ€™m not sure if I could briefly conclude them as he is selling them in a form of a course and a book as well, so I rather not go into details.</p>

<p>The main idea is that at any point you learn the least necessary you need in order to make something work and then you start using it. Now Iâ€™m learning about data bindings and putting it into place. Then I move to stylings and transformations. In a few weeks I will get into a position where I will be in control of my UI and not the examples I find on the internet.</p>

<p>I will also post my findings about <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> and I will blog more about <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> as I plan to deepen my knowledge in it. Stay tuned.</p>
